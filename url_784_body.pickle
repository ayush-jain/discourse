VI have been going back and forth between an XFX Radeon 7870 card and some kind of 7950 card. My main deterrent has been price, and while I'm willing to spend 60-70 more, I don't want to spend it on something crappy. So there are 7950s that are only a bit more expensive, but I'm not sure if they're worth it. They also have a slower mhz rate, and I'm not sure how important that is. Here is my build in case it's relevant: \u000ahttp://pcpartpicker.com/p/soWh

VThe whole concept of a self-clean oven is to burn off any residue on the oven with extreme heat.  Would it work to clean a bowl in this fashion?  I think the oven heats to around 800 degrees F.

VWould a properly annealed piece of glass be affected by this?  Would this basically be re-annealing the glass?  So I would want to bring the temperature down slowly to try to re-anneal properly?
p27

VI have no personal experience but I've been told oven cleaning does work but that it makes the glass 10x easier to break.  My guess is a properly annealed piece would be affected and it's not re-annealing because the temperature to anneal is above 900F.   
p28

VI'm willing to risk it.  the bowl is from 2006.  I've thrown it and dropped it hundreds of times.  I just don't think this bowl has it in it to break on me, and it's so freakin gross inside i can't taste my herb.

I included this because some emulators like Dolphin can be ridiculously intensive on CPU and you want to make sure you can run those without lag. It is housed on an ASRock motherboard with good featureset and reliability.\u000a\u000aWe have 8GB of DDR3 1600MHz RAM which is the standard for gaming and will easily handle everything from light emulation to AAA titles. Unless you have a particular reason for wanting DDR4 (e.g. a certain application that takes advantage of the higher speeds) it's not really worth it at this point in time. \u000a\u000aA reliable 1TB HDD is used for mass storage. If your budget were stretched a bit, we could also include a [120GB SSD](http://de.pcpartpicker.com/part/sandisk-internal-hard-drive-sdssda120gg25) for fast power on times and to reduce the loading times in games, but that's up to you.\u000a\u000aNormally I would recommend an R9 390 over the GTX 970, but you mentioned a particular game (Project Cars) that uses embedded NVIDIA technologies and doesn't run all too well on R9 cards. Those concerns out of the way, this will handle all emulators currently on the market no problem, and should be able to crank out 60FPS high-ultra settings on AAA titles as well.\u000a\u000aEverything's housed in a super-budget MicroATX case that has decent airflow, passable functionality, and acceptable looks. If you're not a stickler for aesthetics you'll love the value of it.\u000a\u000aPowering the build is a reliable and high quality XFX power supply that's also 80+ Bronze to help with your power bills. I also took the liberty of including a DVD drive in case you want to watch movies or play disc games with the build, but feel free to take it out and save 15 euros. \u000a\u000aI hope you like the build and please feel free to message me with any questions!

p36
sI4
VI would rather choose AMD over NVIDIA because because the AMD card in the price range of the GTX 970 (R9 390) has better performance. But, since you're playing Project Cars, you're going to need some NVIDIA techologies.\u000a\u000aSound cards are mostly a gimmick, the motherboard has good enough onboard audio and you likely won't be able to tell the difference with anything under a $100 card.

VI live in an attached house and after my boyfriend and I had a Christmas Eve party the neighbours left me an angry letter in the mailbox. At first I thought it was because of the noise, but it wasn't. \u000a\u000aThey were angry because someone mistook their house for ours. The person tried to open the door once and it was locked so they knocked. The neighbours answered the door and when the person saw that it wasn't the right house they apologized and left. These are basic facts written by both the neighbour in the letter and by the person who went to the wrong house.\u000a\u000aHowever, in the letter, the neighbour completely exaggerates everything. He goes on for a good page about how terrified he was and thank God his door was locked, etc. And than he claims we constantly have people coming in and out of our house without knocking. Which is untrue. Obviously my boyfriend and I go in and out. Sometimes we tell friends they can just come in, but we rarely have people over (I can think of three occasions this year lol) and it has never been more than maybe 5 or 6 people. \u000a\u000aI understand it would be frightening, but no one actually went into his house. It was an honest mistake. I didn't know about it until after the letter or I would have apologized. I left an apology note because it was late at night when I found it. He says if it ever happens again or if he sees the person go to my house (even if they dont knock on his door??) Hes going to call the cops...\u000a\u000aObviously he can call the cops for just about any reason on my house. But I can't actually get in trouble for this? Can I?\u000a\u000aEdit: location is Canada. And I have warned my friends to make sure they have the right house already and will do so again when they actually come over again.

What do you think the possibility of same sex marriages being implementing in the game are? \u000a\u000a\u000aAwhile ago Nintendo had responded to having same sex marriages in Tomdachii Life and said if they have a sequel they may implement it, so at least they are open to it. \u000a\u000aWhat does everyone else think about this, would you like to have it in game or not? Just curious to see what everyone else thinks.

VI decided I wanted to try the Tatuaje Tattoo, after receiving it in my small batch reddit sampler, and tried to find a beer that would pair with it.  After reading a few reviews of the Tattoo, a few of them mentioned a citrusy type flavor.  So I decided to pair it with a nice Belgian Golden ale and see what happened.\u000a\u000ahttp://imgur.com/qNScx9x\u000a\u000aPre-light - A nice rough texture, with a light smell.  It was almost grassy.  When I looked at it in the sun it seems like there were bit of glitter in it, I thought it was very strange.  I used a guillotine cutter and took my first pre-light draw and didn't get much, a little sweetness but was it.  \u000a\u000aPour and first sip - really nice head and deep golden color.  the first sip was very sweet and citrusy, almost like there was an orange in the beer. \u000a\u000ahttp://imgur.com/GiKGkQr\u000a\u000a1st third - Early on the cigar was very light almost grassy.  There was also something else that I couldn't identify, and would continue throughout the cigar and escaped my recognition. As I moved through the first third into the second it started to get more darker in flavor.  Coffee or leather started to come through and I began to get pepper on the retrohale.\u000a\u000a2nd third - It continued its trek into darker territory, good hints of coffee and leather swirled together with the unidentified flavor.  I also think I got a bit of cream here and there. \u000a\u000aFinal third - The coffee and leather continued to dominate the flavor profile. I got a bit of earthiness here and there along with the unidentified flavor. Smoked it down till the smoke got to hot to enjoy and let it go.\u000a\u000aPairing - I definitely got a lot out of this combination.  It was the first time that I had a beer with a cigar and really enjoyed the experience. The beer seems to pull flavors out of the cigar and vice versa. The beer really brought to front the deep coffee flavor of the cigar and the cigar mellowed out the sweetness of the beer. My only regret is that the beer didn't last longer.  I was done with it after about halfway through the cigar.  I would have enjoyed it more if I was able to get a fresh cold beer after this one was done.  Maybe next time I will enjoy one outside at a bar.  \u000a\u000aConclusion - While I enjoyed my time together with this pairing I probably wouldn't do it again.  Contrary to the reviews I had read this cigar seemed to call for something a bit darker.  Maybe a good Imperial stout would have paired better. \u000a\u000aMy beautiful view -  http://imgur.com/wBXF3re

p113
sI1
VThis guy's got the best answer on here right now, but personally I don't think being fluent with the music theory he mentioned is necessary. just study your favorite melodies and producers and emulate their melodies, play them and look for patterns and basic elements. keep emulating and studying these melodies (whatever you choose) till you feel like you really can grasp how to make one like it. you don't need to know about perfect fifths or intervals to make good melodies, sooo many phenomenal musicians don't know shit about theory (although it is definitely a good thing to know). just develop a well trained ear and basic playing skills and you'll be on your way.

VTo add to this, when I thought I had a "basic understanding of theory" I did NOT know about intervals. Incase OP doesn't, that's what you should YouTube and research first "easy ways to recognize intervals"- I had the concept of it, just didn't know how crucial it actually was

Change to Vector (performance suffers)? (not using Collection.synchronizedList API)\u000a* Would the stack's performance suffer if it increased (10x, 100x) and would the methods take much longer? How to help it run in constant time?\u000a\u000aThanks guys.\u000a
p127
sI1
VThanks for the answer. And as per your question--if the stack increased in size, would the methods take much longer to perform? Or same amount of time? I want all of the methods to be able to run in constant time if possible...
p128
sI2
VLike the [documentation for ArrayList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) states, add() operations run in amortized constant time, and remove() operations run in linear time, roughly speaking, (however, since you're removing the *last* item in the list, no subsequent items in the list will need to be shifted, so it will be probably be constant time). \u000a\u000aYour getMax() method will run in linear time, because you're iterating over all items in the list. You can get it to run in constant time if you had a "maxValue" instance variable that you updated when a value is pushed or popped. Though, then your pop() method will need to run in amortized constant time. \u000a\u000a
p129
sI3
VHmm okay, I understand that the getMax() will run in linear time, so you're saying that after each time push() or pop() is used, I change that instance to maxValue? Is there any way you can elaborate on that or provide an example of what the instance variable would look like? You don't have to use my code, I just need more of a lead...
p130
sI4
VIn your push(newValue) method, you might have something like: \u000a\u000a    if (newValue > maxValue)\u000a    {\u000a        maxValue = newValue;\u000a    }\u000a\u000aThe pop method is a little trickier. If the value being popped is the maximum value, you need to find a new maximum value from the items remaining in the list. For example, in your pop() method, you might have something like: \u000a\u000a    int popped = list.remove(list.size()-1); \u000a    if (popped >= maxValue)\u000a    {\u000a        maxValue = // find new max value\u000a    }\u000a    
p131
sI5
VOtherwise, heaps are great for always keeping track of the largest value in a collection, without specifically sorting the collection. O(1) time to find the largest value, and O(log n) to delete it (for reheaping the structure) if I recall correctly. Insertion is O(log n) or O(1) depending on implementation, apparently. I'm not sure if that is quicker than iterating the entire collection each time the max value is removed.

VTwo weekends ago I went to an EDM show and danced with 4 different girls. Getting them to dance with me was about as easy as just saying a few things to them like "Oh shit this song!" or "Do you always dance this good?" and then saying in a commanding voice "You're very attractive and you should dance with me," I didn't have a hard time getting them to dance but then they would stop and walk away and I had no idea why until the next weekend.\u000a\u000aThe next weekend I watched this video before going out:\u000a\u000a* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd3Rs9FxguA\u000aRSD Tyler in night clubs and at Ultra Music Festival\u000a\u000aThis video helped me out a lot and here is how I used it.\u000a\u000aTyler talks about letting the energy of the environment take its effect on you, which to me basically means have fun and enjoy the music. When a song drops that you like, sing, go crazy and let go. This will get you in the mindset of already having fun so you are offering good energy and good emotions.\u000a\u000aI realized where I messed up at the previous concert. When I was dancing with a girl I would focus on getting my energy from her and be mentally focused on dancing with her only. So what I did this time instead, and it is talked about in the RSD video, is alternate between escalating, dancing with her, and pumping up my state. So when a song came on that I liked it was time to pump my state. I would look at my friends and yell out of excitement and jump up and down with the girl next to me. When a slower song would come on, I would then dance with her or start touching her a lot and get real sexual. I would just alternate depending on the song and the mood of the song.\u000a\u000aThe first show where I danced with 4 different girls, I only danced with them for like 5-10 minutes. The girl I danced with after watching RSD Tyler's video was through two artists, so about 2 hours.

I know a lot of girls don't really know what they want and give bullshit advice to guys, but this girl was giving me really solid advice. \u000a\u000aShe explained to me that it's such a turn off if a guy asks her to dance. She wants the guy to tell her, "let's dance" instead. Explained that she wants a guy who can lead her, someone who can deal with her out bursts in a calm manner, and someone who is more dominant than her.\u000a\u000aShe was the first girl I'd ever really talked to that gave me solid advice. Most of my other female friends would just say, "be yourself, be confident, buy her gifts, etc" the bull shit advice that is too generic to yield results.

Thoughts?\u000aEDIT: when he said he had feelings for me, I told him I also had feelings for him. because we were in two different cities at the time (reading week) he called me and we decided we would talk about it when we go back. weve been back for a few days now and it seems to me that hes running from the talk.

VI married my FWB.  It started to get strained when I started having deeper feelings and I didn't know how he felt.  I decided to just go for it and blurted "I love you."  he was silent for a bit.  then "I think I love you too."  Been together 10 years.\u000a\u000aWhat did it change? Not much.  We are still best friends with benefits.\u000a\u000aGood luck OP, and give it chance.  Sounds like he doesn't really know where you stand.
p187
sI2
VIn a period of history where even marriage has no rules... I don't grasp why anyone has any concept that FWB implies some kind of static structure.  If anything, it should be blindingly obvious that 'anything goes' is the true nature of current modern relationships.
p188
sI3
VI agree with you, in sense that it's not "anything goes" but more of a "selective" approach to relationships - though each type (couple, fwb, fuck buddy, marraige, etc.) has their own basic framework and ground rules, people actively select traits from other relationships that they want to implement on their relationship (eg. a coupling centered on sex) thoughts?\u000a\u000athe main issue is that the two people involved in the relationship arent clear or on the same page as to how far the selection goes.
p189
sI4
V> relationship (eg. a coupling centered on sex) thoughts?\u000a\u000aYes. Centering a relationship on the superficial... transitory... sex, money, material of any kind - pretty much is a celebration of that material... and well, won't last a life time.\u000a\u000aSame goes for idol worship ;) you have to go deeper, another 3 layers of dreams. *Inception*\u000a\u000a> the main issue is that the two people involved in the relationship arent clear or on the same page as to how far the \u000a\u000aOf course every individual is unique, and people change. Regardless if they desire change, they do change.\u000a\u000aAnyone who says that a relationship isn't about "changing the other person" is just setting a dynamic end for their relationship. The inevitable change... will come....\u000a\u000aAnd - what people say  - the promises at the start - aren't proving too credible. so the words have all detached from the underlying truth.  Truth is the focal point now, not words or promises.  If you want a relationship that lasts... well, forever, you better focus on truth.  Can two make a truth greater than one? Timeless question you have there ;)

VI hope I'm on in the right place for this question, but I think you can help me.\u000aAt my job we communicate using IRC, and my team just got themselves their own channel. This channel needed a bot. Because on the shell they have at my job the only programming language/scripting language that has a net component is php 4.3.10 I wrote an IRC bot in that language. Currently it's already in use for the things it's necessary for, but I'm constantly expanding it, which means I need to reload it constantly, which I currently do by logging into the server using SSH, killing the script by hand and restarting it.\u000a\u000aIs there a command, or a series of commands in PHP that makes it kill itself, reload itself and restart without me having to do anything outside of the script, or if not, is there a workaround I could use?\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a\u000a\u000aPS. I don't think it's necessary, but if you need access to my full script, the main loop or other snippets, just ask.

VI find myself avoiding the term when I refer to the SO I've been with for the longest (and have the most stable relationship with) \u2014 in my experience it's made some of my other partners feel inferior. I feel a different sort of love for each person I'm with since they all have their own qualities, but the love I have for my long-term SO has more trust (reliability) involved since we've been together for years. I'm hesitant to use "primary partner" since the definitions seem so hazy.\u000a\u000aWhat's your take on the phrase?
p216
sI1
V> This meshes well with the way that poly people often seem to use "primary" and "secondary" - one's primary partner/s are those one lives with, has a family with, raises children with, etc, whilst ones secondary/s tend to be in the "dating" spectrum somewhere. \u000a\u000aWow, really? I hadn't heard this. That seems like a very high bar for "primary." What about people who don't plan on moving in or having kids with anyone, or polyfamilies that don't all live together?

VThat entire post was just my own opinion/perceptions of the matter; I'm not about to make pronouncements on behalf of the community. \u000a\u000a(I even used the weasel word "often" in the part you quoted!)
p218
sI3
VOh I know, I didn't mean to imply that you were making pronouncements; I was just surprised because I wondered why you put the distinction at that level of entanglement
p219
sI4
VI guess in my mind "living life together" is a far cry from "raising children" even though I put them in the same basket - essentially, I'd put the "primary" label at about the stage where a mono couple is ready to move in together.  \u000a\u000aI guess, in the sort of "pre-engagement" stages? (you know, the part of the relationship where you both know that if one of you proposes the other will say 'yes', but nobody's gotten down on one knee yet).
p220
sI5
VThat helps me figure out why I hate the term "primary" -- it seems to assume a specific linear progression of a relationship, the way society assumes monogamous relationships progress in a certain way:\u000a\u000adating -> thinking about living life together -> pre-engagement stage -> move in together -> marriage -> kids\u000a\u000aThe language you use seems to assume that that's how relationships naturally progress. I say this not to criticize you -- I think it's a standard cultural assumption, and I know you weren't speaking about the whole community -- but because this assumption is what bothers me about the primary/secondary terms. None of my relationships, knock on wood, go like that. \u000a\u000aOne of the things I love about poly is that it challenges the sort of "standard model" of relationships, allowing people to freely construct relationship models that work for them, and the primary/secondary model goes along with the assumption that 'serious' relationships will progress linearly like that, and others aren't as serious or important. As the OP put it, the terms do connote monogamy (or at least monogamish) to me.\u000a\u000aBut, there are people whose relationships do work like that, and if that works for them and they find the terms useful, that's great! I just don't like the assumption that that's how poly always, or even usually, works as well.

VHi all. Visiting Portland with some friends in a few weeks. Never been so I dont know the deal with parking and my searches have mostly returned posts about parking tickets so here's my question:\u000aDoes the city of Portland charge to park on the streets overnight? I ask because our hotel charges $40 bucks a night for Valet parking, and they still park the cars on the street. This fee was added in during the room booking. Is this a normal thing? Seems steep but if it's normal, it is what it is.
p224

VThanks for the info, makes sense for where we are.
p225
sI2
VJust to correct a bit - you *can* park on the street overnight. But metering starts at like 7 or 8am and goes until 8 or 10pm, so it's only the latest hours that are OK for free parking.\u000a\u000aBut you would be WAY better off parking in one of the Smartpark or whatever garages and paying their fees to park for the 24 hours or whatever, it wouldn't be anywhere near $40. Hotel valet parking is such a scam.

VThis was originally Q3 from the senior 2011 [Waterloo CCC] (https://cemc.math.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/2011/stage1/seniorEn.pdf)\u000a\u000a\u000a**Problem Description:**\u000a-------\u000a---\u000a\u000aAlice is looking at a crystal through a microscope. Alice\u2019s microscope has the interesting feature\u000athat it can superimpose grid lines over the image that she is looking at.\u000aAt level 1 of magnification, Alice sees the image like this:\u000a\u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/KI2DFyP.png.  \u000a\u000aShe sees the crystal in a 5x5 "grid".\u000a\u000a\u000aNotice that at level 1, there is a 5×5 grid superimposed over the image.\u000aHowever, as Alice increases the magnification, the leaf pattern becomes more intricate \u000a\u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/j8P8Ucu.png\u000a\u000aAt level 2 of the magnification, Alice sees the image with a 25 × 25 grid, and notices that three of\u000athe four larger squares in the original image have the small four square pattern on top. In fact, for\u000athis particular crystal, this self-similarity repeats for each magnification level.\u000a\u000aAlice's microscope has a maximum of 13 levels of magnification.\u000a\u000a\u000aAlice decides associate coordinates to each individual cell in her grid, and lets the current level of magnification equal the integer *m*. This means that (0,0) would be the top left corner and (5^*m*-1, 5^*m*-1) would be the bottom right corner. Given a coordinate (*x*,*y*) and magnification level *m*, Alice wants to whether a crystal can be found at that cell.\u000a\u000a\u000a**Formal Inputs & Outputs**\u000a--\u000a---\u000a\u000aInput description\u000a---\u000a\u000aThe first line of input will be T which is the number of test cases.

VFor two years I worked the graveyard shift (anywhere from 1:00 Pm till 12:00 AM) at a gas station in bum-fuck nowhere. My co-worker and I had a system where we would trade two of our main duties off night by night, which were stocking the walk in drink fridge and cleaning the food area. The person who cleaned the food area also had to run the register until the other had finished with the cooler, just because cleaning the food area was much less tedious. \u000a\u000aOne fateful night around 9:30 or 10:00, on a night when I had to clean the food area, two rednecks pull up in their big jacked up truck. Not out of the ordinary, given my work place's location in the middle of butt-fuck-ville. I dried my hands and made my way over to the register, and as the first guy comes in I notice that he is heavily inebriated. \u000a\u000aI stood behind the register and begin to greet him, and he pulled a 10 inch hunting knife out of his belt, slams it down on the counter, and screams "GIVE ME ALL THE MONEY YOU YUPPIE LITTLE SHIT!" To which I replied with "Whaaaaaaaa???" and almost shitting/peeing my pants. We have a little verbal exchange, (which I honestly don't remember, I was extremely scared) through which I discover his intentions are supposed to be humorous. \u000a\u000aGuy no. 2 comes in and stands behind him right after Guy no. 1 slammed his huge fucking knife down in front of me and stood there for a minute or so, until he finally decided to step in and take his friend's knife away and push him back out to the truck.  \u000a\u000aThey got their gas and hillbilly no. 1 came back in and tried to apologize to me, but I was so scared/shocked that I didn't really know what to do or say. \u000a\u000aIn retrospect, I really should have called the cops.\u000a\u000aTL;DR: Drunk guy comes in with big ass knife and jokes about robbing me.

ViOS 7 isn't as buggy as people make it seem. It's completely up to the user of the device if they want to test waters and try out the beta, you don't have to be a developer just to try the beta. 
p247
sI2
VA beta isn't something you *try*. It's purpose is to receive feedback so that when it released to the public it isn't a mess.\u000a\u000aIn Apple's intended world, you have to be a paying developer (as in, actually part of the Apple Developer Program) to have access to iOS betas. However, some people abuse this by selling portions of developer accounts to the masses (which is wrong, and causes mass violation of Apple's NDA, which is technically illegal).
p248
sI3
VHow are they supposed to get feedback if people don't *try* the betas?  Betas aren't only for developers. \u000a\u000aI do understand how you feel about people pirating the beta and not paying for the UDID, but I can't particularly judge since my phone's running the beta and I can't say that I paid for the UDID account. 
p249
sI4
V*People* aren't supposed to try the betas. Developers are. The ones that actually understand how to provide good feedback.\u000a\u000aIf "Betas aren't only for developers", then why does Apple restrict iOS beta access to paying developers only? Sure seems like they want betas to be only for developers.\u000a\u000a(FYI: You are using UDID wrong. UDID is the Unique Device IDentifier. You pay for it when you buy your device. There is no such thing as a "UDID account". What you are thinking of is "UDID Activation", which means that your unique device is granted permission to install beta software, based on the identifier associated with your device. This is intended to be for paying developers only, as well as 10 other devices of their choice, I believe. However some people buy developer accounts and sell each UDID activation as a fraction of the total developer account cost, which is in violation of many agreements.)\u000a\u000aEDIT: Not to mention the trouble it causes when non-devs adopt pre-release firmwares. Imagine being an app dev and getting complaints that "your app doesn't work with iOS 7", when iOS 7 hasn't even been released (and dev's aren't allowed to update for iOS 7 until AFTER it's public release). That happens painfully often, and it is caused solely by people that are not devs but have obtained access to the beta through unintended methods.
p250
sI5
VWell that's fair, I don't particularly have an argument for that haha. I understand where you're coming, and I totally agree it's probably aggravating to developers when users keep complaining about how their app doesn't work for iOS 7 yet.  \u000a\u000aAnd whoops, I guess I don't know enough of what I'm talking about! Didn't really know the difference between a UDID account and activation! \u000a\u000aTo answer OP's question though, probably don't do it seeing as you can't downgrade from iOS 7 to iOS 6.1.2, only 6.1.3 or 6.1.4 if you're on an iPhone 5

VSo the Uchigatana seems like an obvious early weapon choice, and scales well into the mid-game. And it's looking like the Chaos is going to be my weapon of choice late-game, with the higher base damage and A-level scaling with dex. But here's the question: What other weapons work well with the Mercenary? Perhaps more importantly, what about armor?
p281
sI1
VYeah, thank you. That's pretty obvious. But RPGs are, for me, about getting into a character. I'm not going to start as a mercenary just to play as a knight. I'm going to play as a mercenary to play the agile and fast mercenary.
p282
sI2
VWell your question didn't specificy that. Based on your question the answer is yes, any weapon can work well with as a Mercenary, as can any armor set.\u000a\u000aWe don't know your arbitrary rules. To you Mercenary may mean dexterous Rogue-like scoundrel. To another it may mean something completely different.\u000a\u000aTo answer your follow up, there are plenty of Dex based weapons and lighter armor sets to use. If you want a list, go check out the wiki.

p284

VYou asked a stupidly broad, open ended question. I answered based on what you asked and that wasn't good enough because you failed to give clarity to the actual information you wanted. You understand that there are people posting questions on reddit every day like "when does my Knight turn into a Paladin", so how the heck should I know if you understand that a Mercenary ultimately has access to the same items that a Knight or Cleric can?\u000a\u000aWhat do you want? Suggestions for Armor type? You don't want to look like a Knight so wear something with more cloth and leather. Sellsword, Thiefs and Asssassins are good starting points available early on. I don't know what you're looking for in terms of aesthetics, so again, the wiki would be a better source of information due to having pictures.\u000a\u000aWeapon suggestions? Anything that scales with Dex. Curved Swords, Rapiers, Spears, Halberds, maybe a bow. All of these are obtainable in the first area of the game.

V(title really should say the main BACKGROUND/mythology informing the plot of my campaign)\u000a\u000aHey guys, I've been running a story-heavy D&D 4E campaign (soon to be 5E, definitely gonna switch due to the more freeform-ness and potential for much faster, gridless combat etc) in a world of my own creation called Valgard (peep our ObsidianPortal page with pretty detailed wiki here: https://ancientechoes.obsidianportal.com/) for over a year and the party is finally about to reach Paragon tier, and the main elements of the story have started to take center stage with many mysteries starting to unravel etc.\u000a\u000aTo summarize VERY briefly, the campaign kicked off with mysterious black-masked riders looting an unknown artifact from an ancient elven tomb, and the players following the trail and eventually learning that the masked riders call themselves The Unbroken, since revealed to be a widespread evil cult venerating a mysterious figure known as The Sunderer. The object the Unbroken looted from the tomb was a piece of an ancient ritual tablet/wheel/macguffin (the purpose of which has yet to be revealed) and they are searching for more fragments, all the while abducting people and performing vile experiments on them to perfect the art of Warforging (with various horrifying degrees of success/failure), though their attempts are crude at best compared to the original Warforged (divine legionaries created during the Dawn War by The Sunderer, as detailed below)\u000a\u000aAnyway, here is a bit of the overall backstory/campaign arc/goals of the antagonists, and I pretty much am just needing some outside eyes/ears/brains to help make sure there aren't any major contradictions/plot holes/dumbshit ideas in there, since its been revised and rewritten numerous times.    \u000a    \u000a***\u000a\u000aHere ya go:\u000a\u000a* Cairoth was a smith god, called The Shaper by his brothers; he was a close friend of Moradin, with whom he shared a love of and aptitude for creation. He was a meticulous craftsman, obsessed with perfection and strength of form, who despised weakness and frailty; he aided the other gods in the creation of the myriad beings that came to inhabit Valgard, but was never satisfied with their results, despairing at the (to his immortal standards) short lifespans and fragile natures of the men and dwarves and elves he helped shape. He longed to create beings that would endure the turning of the ages and carry forth the tales of the magnificent age of creation and the works of the gods. \u000a\u000a\u000a* After the terrible conflict known as the Dawn War began, Cairoth created the first Warforged by experimenting upon the captured life essences of fallen gods and primordials alike, harvested in secret from the battlefields of the Astral Sea; these essences (in effect their very souls) were stripped of all identity, melted down into a uniform slurry of creation-stuff, and used to power a great forge (which he called the Black Forge) that then birthed living, sentient beings of metal, utterly subservient to their creator. Cairoth hid these methods from the other gods, for he knew they would find them abhorrent. \u000a\u000a\u000a* Legions of Cairoth's Warforged streamed from his astral domain and bolstered his divine brethren, helping turn the tide of the war and drive the primordials to their ultimate defeat. The gods marveled at these soldiers who obeyed unquestioningly, fought tirelessly, were more durable than even the angelic cohorts and were able to exist in the mortal world for a seemingly unlimited period, unlike the angels and other divine beings whose strength waned and form ultimately faded if they did not return to the Astral Sea.\u000a\u000a\u000a* In the aftermath of the Dawn War, one of Cairoth's brothers discovered the means by which he had built the Warforged and confronted him; Cairoth slew him in a rage but his victim (whose name has since been forgotten by all but the gods themselves) told Cairoth with his dying breath that he had already dispatched messengers to warn the other gods. Cairoth, knowing he would never be forgiven for this ultimate sin, set upon one last great work; he poured a portion of his own essence and identity into the forge and created an artifact that would allow some part of him to endure should he be slain, as well as grant passage to his domain should it be sealed. He commanded Neraxis, one of his Exarchs, to spirit away this artifact (which he dubbed the Wheel of Dominion) into the mortal world when the domain seemed sure to fall, so he might hide and plot vengeance in time. Then he made his domain ready for the war that would surely soon come.\u000a\u000a\u000a* The gods laid siege to the domain of their brother Cairoth, whom they named Sunderer for shattering their bonds with his heinous treachery. Eventually, Cairoth's domain was breached and its defenders crushed; the Warforged were all broken and heaped atop one another, forming a mountain of bodies whose summit reached the clouds of Cairoth's realm. \u000a\u000a\u000a* Cairoth himself was captured; the gods argued then about what his fate should be, and in the end it was decided that too many of their own had fallen between the Dawn War and Cairoth's treachery. Cairoth was imprisoned rather than slain, forced to work the Black Forge one last time, building his own cage of dull black iron, into which he was thrust; Moradin crafted the lock that went on the cage, and keeps the key on a chain around his neck to this day. Cairoth's domain was sealed and abandoned, a desolate and forbidding isle floating through the Astral Sea, the Black Forge long dormant. Cairoth himself dwells caged in the heart of this tomb-like domain, powerless and forgotten.\u000a\u000a\u000a* Neraxis escaped with the Wheel during the siege, but his desperate flight ended in disaster; damaged from the siege and pursued by angels, the Exarch's essences were bleeding away. The Wheel of Creation was shattered in battle with the pursuing angels, and its pieces scattering across the land when they crossed into the mortal realm. Neraxis, managing to overcome his pursuers, was heavily damaged and forced to enter a state of suspended animation in order to preserve his waning essence so that he might survive. His vessel came to rest in a remote valley, southwest of what would eventually be called Lake Mythras by the men who settled the surrounding lands. \u000a\u000a\u000a* Many millennia later, almost eight centuries after the event known as The Flood (a magical cataclysm caused by the overthrow and death of the ageless mage-lords that ruled the old Bal-Shanaari Empire, resulting in magic users everywhere going mad and causing decades of strife and a long-lasting stigma towards arcane magic), an elderly hedge witch from nearby Old Talys named Akantha came upon the inert Neraxis while fleeing persecution following the discovery of her talents. The woman was sickly and infirm, and she had been caught performing blasphemous arcane experiments upon vagrants in an attempt to test the efficacy of various spells and rituals she hoped would help her prolong her life and stave off death.  \u000a\u000a\u000a* Akantha studied the looming, vine- and moss-covered figure, and sensing her probing, Neraxis' consciousness stirred. Neraxis reached out and began to whisper into the mind of Akantha, who despaired over the frailty of man and sought a way to become stronger and transcend her mortality. The voice whispered of a new flesh, a flesh of iron that would endure the ages and stave off illness and death. The whispers continued for months until Neraxis had a strong enough hold on Akantha's mind, and he bent her to his will. Through this woman, the cult of Cairoth was born, and the bidding of Neraxis was done. He gathered others to him over time, and they were tasked by their leader to seek out the pieces of the Wheel, so that Cairoth might be freed from his prison. Over the past two centuries, the Unbroken has grown into a shadowy organization with conspirators scattered throughout Aritae, all questing for the hidden artifacts that will allow them to enter Cairoth's forbidden domain and seek a means to bring about the return of their master. Through a combination of Neraxis' knowledge and Akantha's studies of the Exarch, they have also learned a small part of the Warforging process, and have created a number of lesser Warforged (though they pale in comparison to the originals, created from raw god-stuff) as well as discovered the processes by which a living man might replace parts of himself with Warforged elements, growing stronger and sturdier thereby.\u000a    \u000a***\u000a\u000a\u000a**Cairoth/Unbroken/Neraxis Goals**\u000a\u000a* Recover fragments and reassemble Wheel of Dominion (currently possessing 6 fragments, out of a total of 13)\u000a\u000a* Revitalize/repair/reawaken the dormant Neraxis using essence of Cairoth contained in Wheel fragments\u000a\u000a* Harvest mortals to convert into Warforged \u000a\u000a* Enter Cairoth's forgotten domain using the reassembled Wheel of Dominion and find a way to free the caged god\u000a\u000a* Make war upon the other gods\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000a**Twists**\u000a\u000a* Akantha was Melekhemnides' (a player character who is basically Darth Revan in that he was a hugely powerful nearly immortal mage-lord of the old Bal-Shanaari Empire that collapsed 1000 years ago, who survived but had his mind wiped and is now a crazy old hedge wizard, but is slowly regaining his memories) consort, and herself a powerful mage in the Bal-Shanaari Empire who took ill with a wasting disease; she survived The Flood because some years earlier, after a particularly trying bout of illness, Melekhemnides took her to a secret lair he maintained in Talys, placing her in stasis to preserve her so that he could study her illness in the hopes of curing her someday. The Flood weakened her stasis field and eventually it fizzled; Akantha awoke alone in the laboratory/hideout, and after acclimating to her surroundings and discovering the time that had lapsed, set out to finish Melekhemnides' work (which led to her being discovered and subsequently fleeing, and eventually stumbling upon Neraxis)\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aSo...whatcha think, guys? Super convoluted? Interesting? \u000a\u000aSo far the Warforged (which were not revealed until like 6 levels in) have been a big hit because they are not an established part of the world's lore, so they were a mysterious, Terminator-like enemy. Also lots of awesome minions/human Unbroken with horrid self-forged modifications like robot arms and shoulderbows and shit. The players have enjoyed tangling with these freaks.\u000a\u000a
p296
sI1
VThanks for the feedback, glad youre digging it! This is exactly the kind of question and analysis I need; detail ideas/questions that might not have occurred to me, that the players will need to figure out, etc.\u000a\u000aAs of now, they don't know the total number of shard fragments. They are in possession of one fragment themselves, and they know for a fact the Unbroken have another, and they were given the vague location of the third (adorning a drow noble's art collection in his estate in a big drow metropolis in the Underdark) by a friendly NPC (leader of a thieves' guild, drow chick who fled her home years ago and set up shop in the underworld in one of the larger city-states on the surface).\u000a\u000aI've toyed with numerous ideas concerning how they learn the total number of shards...the easiest way to handle it would be that Neraxis was aware of how many pieces it shattered into, and thus the Unbroken are aware. It then becomes a simple matter of the PC's interrogating some Unbroken lieutenant or possibly getting the information after defeating a higher-up (depends how widespread the knowledge is throughout the cult itself).\u000a\u000aA bigger question is this: how do the PCs know where to look for the other fragments, if they've all fallen in different places across the world? I'm considering having them come into possession of a ritual that lets them do a sort of Object Reading type deal on the shard fragments they possess; since the shards contain a portion of the big bad forgotten god's essence/consciousness, they may be linked and thus provide flashes of imagery or clues as to the locations of other shards. Following that logic, the more pieces the party accumulates, the more accurate and stronger the readings become, giving them more specific direction.\u000a\u000aWhat do you think?
p297
sI2
VOooh, just thought of some other cool shit...the more pieces they acquire, the stronger the consciousness/presence gets, right? Well what if it starts reaching out to one of the PC's, unbeknownst to the rest of the group, and whispers to him in the night, beginning a slow corruption that grows over the course of the campaign until manifesting itself sometime later down the road? :D

VMy buddy runs a small 10 room bed and breakfast. He has two tv per room and what he is looking to do is get wireless headphones for each tv. There are 20 tvs total.\u000aThe problem is this:\u000aSince the rooms are all wall to wall, and the tvs are only 5 feet apart from one another, what kind of headphones can he set up that will not intercept each other.\u000a\u000aI offered the idea that maybe he can just buy 4 sets of different brands, but since I have no real knowledge about radio frequency etc I am not sure if that will help.\u000a\u000aThe second part that is an issue is the receiver station. He wants to hide the receiver station behind the tv. However, it looks like all the headphones use the same piece of equipment as the receiver and the charging station. This means you can't hide it behind the tv, since you won't be able to charge it.\u000a\u000aI am sure someone out there has a creative solution, can you guys recommend anything?

VArlowe Acilius awoke in his quarters, having slept very little. His rest had been plagued by the usual nightmares, his students rebelling in the middle of a sermon, hooded figures breaking into his room at night, and his deceased wife rising from the grave. It had been a few years since Arlowe had gotten any proper sleep, not since he became the Professor of Metaphysics at the Arcane University. He tired of giving the same few lectures to different groups of equally faceless apprentices, and never feeling any sense of accomplishment. He was once able to occupy himself during the night with his studies, but the library had recently run out of fresh material for him. Without any chance to partake in the words of others, he was forced to write his own.  \u000a\u000aArlowe approached the podium, and took a moment to observe the congregation before him. A fair amount of apprentices had showed up, eager to learn, quills and ears at the ready. Arlowe sighed, and stroked his grizzly beard. How much longer would he have to suffer this dreary existence?  \u000a\u000a"Today, apprentices, I would like to cover a topic we have hardly touched on. I wish to enlighten you on a subject of a darker tone than usual. Today I wish to discuss Sithis."  \u000a\u000aThe apprentices responded with mixed emotions. Some were eager to stray into something new, some were uncomfortable with the morbid idea, and others were dismissive. Sithis is just The Void, is he not, what could there be to learn about nothing?  \u000a\u000a"As we all know, Sithis is synonymous with The Void. Sithis is no god, no, Sithis is one level past any tangible god. We all know of Anu and Padomay, yes? The first primordial forces that shaped existence. We have also learned of Aka and Lorkhan, who were born as time and space, realizations of Anu and Padomay. In between them lies another sub-gradient, the souls of the original two, Anui-El and Sithis. As per usual, these two serve as direct opposites, these being everything and nothing. Sithis is nothing itself, the infinite emptiness too absurd for our perceptions. Within Sithis is nothing, but we, as mere mortals, cannot comprehend true nothing. We are too far removed from Sithis to understand, I believe the Ada can understand it, but not us. Try and imagine nothing. What do you see? An infinite blackness, I assume. But that is nothing, it is still an image of blackness. You cannot imagine nothing, our minds are too simple. Sithis, as we've said, cannot be directly perceived, but the result of it can. Some claim that Sithis was the first, which is a believable idea, for what can come before everything but nothing? And the only thing that can come before nothing is nothing. Nothing gave way for everything, where stasis and change could fuel time and space, and all of the Aurbis could function. In the Dawn, we know there was no time, so Sithis came from Padomay, but also emerged at the same time. Perhaps Sithis really is the start of the house. However, what that damned league of assassins is wrong about is the nature of their 'Dread Father.'"  \u000a\u000aA rather rebellious youth, Antoine Marienne, interrupted. "And just what do you mean by that? Sithis is a god like any other."  \u000a\u000a"And that is where you too are wrong. Sithis is a force, Lorkhan is the first being with identity. Remember that the precious 'Night Mother' is widely regarded as an aspect of Mephala. The way I see it, the assassins are just being manipulated by the Webspinner, and the Daedroth needed a being to scapegoat, one that does not have a voice of its own. The Sithis of the Dark Brotherhood is hardly the Sithis of the Aurbis, it is merely a fabrication. Sithis is a void in which nothing can ever be, and nothing will ever be, not the shepard for some band of heathens. But, enough about nothing, open your books to chapter 12, section 35: On the Nature of Trans-Kalpic Transportation..."  \u000a\u000aArlowe sat at his desk and wrote and wrote. If he had nothing left to read, he would leave others with new material. He had become fixated on Sithis. How can nothing be? Wouldn't the fact that the nothing is there mean that it is something? Sithis is an identity, and an identity is something. How do we even know this nothing exists?  \u000a\u000aThere was a knock at the door.  \u000a\u000aAnd it was the last sound he ever heard.
p324
sI1
VYou are correct. Sithis cannot be communicated to and it cannot act because it is not a sentient thing. Aka and Lorkhan are the "highest-tiered" things with sentience, and Sithis is a step above them. However, it is closer to Lorkhan than Padomay is, in that nothing is more conceivable than pure chaos. Sithis is the closest thing to sentience without sentience.  \u000a I'm not sure if many people around play Dark Souls, but I interpret Sithis much like the Abyss, pure entropy and emptiness in which nothing can reside. Think of the ending to Isaac Asimov's [*The Last Question*](http://filer.case.edu/dts8/thelastq.htm) (a fantastic story, I'd reccomend it to anyone). Absolutely nothing, a void of less than emptiness, for emptiness implies that it may be filled.  \u000aAnd thank you for the compliment. I find my uneducated philosophies easy to "smarten up" with a nice story, it makes the reader want to pay attention more.
p325
sI2
VSo Sithis is literally a void, a name given to absolute nothingness because everything has to have a name. So if Sithis is absolute nothingness, then essentially the Dark Brotherhood worships nothing. This is where it gets hazy to me. I can understand the Brotherhood worshiping their Night Mother, possibly worshiping a Daedra such as Nocturnal, or just operating on their own, but are they just oblivious? Do *they* think that Sithis is a higher being? Or do they just associate themselves with it because people cannot fathom absolute nothingness, so it makes them seem as mysterious and frightening as the Void itself? I'm interested in hearing your opinion on this.\u000a\u000aOn a side note, I played a little Dark Souls and just didn't enjoy it at all, and I'll start reading that text that you linked now
p326
sI3
VThe Night Mother is highly theorized to be Mephala in disguise, seeing as how they branched from the Morag Tong. Their representations in the games strike me as just plain wrong about Sithis. They think of him as their Dread Father who married the Night Mother, and they are the metaphorical children of that union. They also mention that slaying someone in the name of Sithis sends their soul to The Void. Honestly, that's a terrifying concept, just having your entire soul erased rather than have any sort of afterlife.  \u000aI think the Dark Brotherhood is just misguided, but they are a cult after all, their beliefs are meant to be rather far fetched. The earlier mentioned book *Sithis* does a good job of depicting Sithis as the supreme creator, while remaining true to it being nothing if taken metaphorically.
p327

V> Honestly, that's a terrifying concept, just having your entire soul erased rather than have any sort of afterlife.\u000a\u000aAnd here we have the reason behind the creation of literally every religion IRL.

VHey guys, I built my dad's computer and installed windows and everything just fine, but when I tried to enter the bios to check a few things and do some configuration, the splash screen did not even appear and went directly to the windows loading screen.\u000a\u000aThis is not immediately a problem, but I really want to reenable this feature.

VAdept minor vs grandmaster minor is kind of irrelevant with the introduction of specializations. You automatically take all three with whatever spec you choose.\u000a\u000aAlso, the argument is two-fold. \u000a\u000a* If eles have adequate access to speed, then having a +10% on air that will be overwritten in any situation is pointless and the trait should be replaced with something useful.\u000a\u000a* If eles *don't* have adequate access to speed, then it should be on par with similar traits.\u000a\u000aTruth be told, even if zephyr's speed was changed to 25%, the mesmer version would still be vastly superior because it has the -condi duration rolled in. Not to mention the ele version **only** working while they're in air attunement.

Thanks so much! I've loved reading what others in this community have had to say about their experiences and gear
p354
sI1
VI noticed a couple comments about this lens on Amazon stating that this lens is not designed for portrait use, what kind of effects would I see if I used it for a portrait? Is it even worth worrying about?
p355
sI2
VIt's because the lens is so wide that if you get too close to the subject, or if the subject is near the edge of the frame, he/she will look distorted (certain features are enlarged or stretched unnaturally).  That's why typically for portraits, you would want a telephoto lens to compress the subject's face in a more natural and flattering way.\u000a\u000aedit: You still can take portraits with an ultra wide angle lens, as long as you try to keep the subject in the center of the frame and at a distance so as not to distort facial features.

VSo in the next 2-3 months, I have decided to finally come forward to my parents and let them know that this religion is not for me. They know I don't go to meetings or service already, but keep trying to encourage me to go and I go whenever I visit them (they live 1 hour away). They don't know I have a gf yet, and I feel terrible hiding this from them and she's starting to feel hidden as well, even though she's very understanding of my situation. Knowing my parents, I know that it would be almost impossible for them to shun me, partially due to the fact that none of our extended family are JW, and this would cause them to be even more isolated than they are now.\u000a\u000aNow I'm just asking for others to relate how their experience went. I think I will tell them that I'm exhausted from it, and have been for the past several years. Tired of the labels, tired of the elders breathing down my back, tired of the fake love, tired of seeing them get taken advantage of by others in the cong. Now I have brought these points up with them in the past, and always get the standard "the org is imperfect blah fucking blah." They just can't get it thru their heads that I do not expect perfection from anyone, but that I don't care about anyone in the hall other than my family, and just want to live a simpler life, where I can fully focus on my family, my schooling (yay for higher education!), my SO and friends. And even if they're right, I would rather die than spend eternity in a paradise full of JWs. That's a very special version of hell in my books.\u000a\u000aThis HAS to happen soon. A sibling of mine is getting married soon so I've been keeping it light. But once that's out of the way there's no going back. So please ExJW, tell me how that nail in the coffin conversation went for you. I'm not a regular poster, but have been lurking for months. I credit this place for getting me in the position I am now. I love you all. Cheers!

Since I don't have insurance I've been stretching out my meds as long as possible, dreading what the grand total would be. It was pretty common for me to pay $200 a script with insurance. \u000a\u000aSo, without insurance it came to $325. The pharmacist saw that and was shocked. She took my meds in the back and whatever she did, when she came back, all three of my meds came out to $16. She saved me over $300! It's small, but it definitely made my day.

VHi Rideit, I have a quick question!\u000a\u000aMy bike is stored for the winter (outside), and today I was doing my usual Bi-Monthly start up and running to get the condensation out the engine, and stop it seizeing up.\u000a\u000aI checked the oil level through the oil window, and noticed a very small layer of white on the top of my oil, after I ran the bike.\u000aNormally, this would lead me to think that the head gasket had gone, but my motorcycle is oil cooled, so there is no water in the engine. \u000a\u000aIs it just condensation? Or do I have a serious problem? Should I change the oil? \u000a\u000aThanks in advance!

VUnfortunately I don't have the right license to drive it yet, so I don't have much choice =[
p400
sI2
VI think what b0ules is trying to say is STOP starting your bike. In the winter if you aren't going to ride your bike, then don't start it. Just put it down and say good bye for the winter. Every time you turn it on you are generating more condensation. \u000a\u000aSo for now, stop touching it. In the spring do an oil change.
p401
sI3
VOk thanks. Any idea why not actually riding the bike is bad? I roll it around to stop tyre damage.
p402
sI4
Vthe kind of heat and friction you are creating in the bike by idling it for 30 minutes cannot properly replicate all of the stresses and forces that are imposed by riding, especially since the driveline doesn't engage. So enough heat is created at idle to generate condensation, but not enough to burn that condensation off, instead the condensation that is generated is just dropping into your oil. Same thing is happening in your gas tank. The heat from your engine is rising up and heating up your gas tank, but only enough to generate condensation in your tank. Not enough to actually cook that moisture off. so it is dropping the moisture into your gas.  I don't think you did any major damage, just stop doing it and learn for the future.\u000a\u000aMoving the bike around for the tires is fine with it turned off. It sounds like you may be a victim of overcautiosness though. When I put my bike down in the fall, I am very thorough with checks and fluid changes, pull the battery and such. but once it is down, a cover goes over it and I don't see it again until spring.

sI3
VBut are they really attacking Constitutional rights or simply your own personal interpretation of those rights? There is a big difference. The NRA believes in unlimited gun rights which the Supreme Court has clearly stated doesn't exist as a right under the 2nd Amendment.  In the 2008 D.C. versus Heller case, very conservative Justice Scalia wrote for the majority of the Court "**Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose**: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court\u2019s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. Miller\u2019s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those \u201cin common use at the time\u201d finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons".

Seems quite doable as long as the baby momma pops a multivitamin, some folic acid supplements (since blueberries would be decidedly un-keto), and some Omega 3 supplements (since I would be a bit reticent to advise a pregnant or nursing woman to eat more fish, in case there are Mercury or other toxicity concerns).  
p415
sI2
VSure.  Definitely doable.  Our ancestors have been doing it for perhaps *a million years or two*. :)\u000a\u000aAs for fish: salmon is the safest and has very little mercury.  The dangerous mercury fish are the predators -- the top of the foodchain fish.  Tuna for example is a big predator fish.  It eats other fish, so mercury can get concentrated in its body since its an apex predator.  I wouldn't have more than 1 or 2 servings of tuna a week given that.\u000a\u000aBut salmon -- it's not an apex predator.  It's pretty safe.  And has a really good Omega-3 ratio.\u000a\u000aAlso don't forget grass fed anything has a really good omega-3-to-6 ratio.  Grassfed beef, or butter or cheese from grassfed cows is really good.  It makes taking an omega-3 supplement unnecessary.\u000a\u000a\u000a

I've seen that on the tomshardware gpu hierarchy that they are on the same level, but I've read some people claiming the 290x to be much better with no explanation.\u000a\u000aany reason for a z97 and 4690k? the only differences I've read, are more over clocking capacity, and I don't plan to overclock much.\u000a\u000athe OS was a personal decision along with the pc case, I just liked it.\u000a\u000aand thank you so much for your reply!
p443
sI2
VThe 290x has a few more processing units and a higher clock speed. As for the 4690k and z97, the prices are about the same as a 4670k and z87, so the extra overclocking and other features are worth it.\u000a\u000aAs for the case, I was going to suggest a phantek enthoo pro.
p444
sI3
Vokay thank you so much for the explanation and I'm looking into it now, and it seems i can get a 4690k and z97 for the exact same price on newegg!\u000a\u000aI have looked at the phantek enthoo pro, and it is really nice, however I am trying to stay away from a full tower. I'd like to do a mid tower build.\u000a\u000aalso, I forgot to acknowledge the power supply. I was thinking about changing out the Corsair CX600 with a CX600M (I think that's what it was called) because it was semi-modular and only 30 bucks more
p445
sI4
VWhile, I wouldn't pay $60+ for a cx600m, going semi-modular is definitely something I would recommend.
p446
sI5
Vwell the difference between the two on newegg was like 5 bucks, but pcpartpicker somehow got a $30 discount on the cx600 from newegg, and since I plan to purchase everything from newegg (and that's also where I found everything before listing them on pcpartpicker) the price change won't hurt too much. \u000aChanging from the his 290x to the his 290 dropped the price down $130! I also watched some comparison videos this morning of the difference between gpus (290, 290x, 780, 780ti) and there wasn't much difference between the 290 and 290x other than the a few frames per second, so thank you again for your input cause that just saved me a bunch!

VOk, so to start I have a psychology degree, good grades (not good enough for masters..so I'm stuck :( ) , volunteering (all through university, in different fields), professor references and I have not found ANYTHING. Moving is out of the question as I cannot be moving away for a barely above minimum wage job in a more expensive city (ie. Toronto, where the jobs are). I feel like psychology was a huge mistake. I graduated last June, for reference. \u000a\u000aTo present: I  am in my second week (yea, week) of a grade 11 functions course as I am trying to pursue engineering. This is the most basic shit, factoring, adding, subtracting, dividing  and multiplying rational expressions but I cannot grasp it. I don't have these credits from high school and its been 7 years now since I graduated...so I need basically all my maths. I am discouraged already, and I'm ready to give up on the whole dream of being an engineer and having a successful future. Its not just about engineering, these maths are very important for a bunch of disciplines. I can't study because I am sad I cannot even grasp something so simple as this.\u000a\u000aDo you guys have any strategies for this stuff? Im already behind in life, 23 with no (professional?) job and this is adding more depression and I don't know what to do with my life.\u000a\u000aEDIT: I'll add now that yes, I am employed, I also have zero desire to continue in the psychology field so I really want to obtain my maths :(
p450
sI1
VYou're 100% correct, but I noticed I have absolutely zero background, not just gaps. I cannot start a very basic equation because I don't know how to factor well. I have a test tomorrow and will try my hardest but I guess the next option would be try to get the grade 10 math, come back to this grade 11 and just push engineering back another year or so :( That is assuming I'm just behind, and not terrible at math :(

VI think i pretty much went back to grade 7 or 8 equivalent,  haha.  I really strongly suggest you check out khan Academy videos.  I was awful at math,  and just spent hours on there.  Also,  get some one on one time with your instructors,  or get a tutor. .  It can be invaluable. \u000a\u000aAnyone can do math.  It's about how much work you're willing to put into it. 
p452
sI3
VAll I've been doing is watching youtube videos. I have not tried Khan Academy yet, as I've watched one of their videos and it wasn't my style. The teacher went too fast. I am really,really slow with math. All i can do till tomorrow night is keep practicing though
p453

p454
sI5
VNo, what I mean is he sometimes did not show all his steps. he'd say something like oh hey, this is like this, and because this is like this, we can do this. And theeen instead of showing the work or why, he would just write the final thing. And since he didn't write the work in-between, I get lost. I promise you, one single thing changes between and equation and the next one, I am 100% lost. My whole days has been youtube videos. Fort Bend Tutoring and PatrickJMT are my favourite.

VWell long exposures are not hard technically since the buildings don't move so all you need to do is put the camera on a tripod, pick your highest quality ISO (100 or 200 usually), pick your sharpest f/stop (f/8 usually works out well), and expose for that.  The little tricks to fine tune it however takes a while!  Oh and definitely shoot raw.

VYea I got the basics down of long exposures after several tries lol, & yea RAW is definitely the way to go! Maybe sometime we can explore downtown and shoot(can learn a thing or 2 from you) lol. Thats what me and my friends do, Just get our cameras and head out to different places.

VHi guys so I wrote a post earlier asking for good sales books to read and after browsing through the best of /r/sales I decided to read SPIN selling\u000a\u000aLong story short, I loved how the book was based on research and not just someone telling me what he thinks is right/wrong.  I finished it really quick because it was great to read.  Here are the point that got me thinking (I am talking in terms of big sales not small ones);\u000a\u000a1- If you build something that actually solves a problem, it will be a lot easier to sell it if you got the right customer segment (service/product that solves problem for the right price + correct target group = success!)\u000a\u000a2- Sometimes people have a problem they are unaware of.  The job of a good sales person is to make the customer see that problem and how bad it is.  The problem has to be bad enough that it is worth solving\u000a\u000a3- The key is that you create more value to the customer than what he pays you for solving the problem (so problem is costing him 500$ but you will get rid of it for 200$)\u000a\u000a4- You can't start talking about selling right away! You gota lead your customer towards his problem, make him see how big it is, then propose a solution (or even better he can propose the solution himself)\u000a\u000a5- Big sales take place when you are NOT around.  This was one of my favorite points; after you do the presentation or the sales pitch, people will still meet and decide; it is rare that people decide in front of you when it comes to big b2b sales\u000a\u000aI am starting a sales and business development job in June so I don't have any experience in big b2b sales but I have some experience from my small entrepreneurial venture which I had to do for my master's degree.  Now, I am wondering how true are the points I made above in real life?  Are they true at all?  What is your experience when it comes to big b2b sales?
p472
sI1
VHey, be nice to us car salesmen. Some of us use aspects of SPIN as well. 
p473
sI2
VI apologize.  No really, what you do is tough, and I admire the tenacity.  I was painting with a very broad brush and that was wrong.  I have had exactly one tolerable car sales experience though.  All of the others have been why the cliche is a cliche.  If you can tell me the magic words I need to say to go to a dealer and buy a car in less than 6-8 hours of tedium, I would appreciate it.  Is there a secret handshake, or a Mason style pinkie ring I need?
p474
sI3
VSadly no. I agree that it is a generally a pain in the ass all around. One of my biggest frustrations is that I am constantly working against how our process works. Some of it is how the system works and some of it is just sloppy. We do have A LOT of paperwork to get a deal done. It is one of the biggest purchases many individuals will make in their lives. There is a lot of legal paperwork we have to do to cover our ass and be complaint with state and national regulations. But at the same time it always feels like we are working uphill. \u000a\u000aI can help to speed things along perhaps. \u000a\u000aFirst, front load the majority of your work. By that I mean pick out a car and a yes or no price for it. You can find good market pricing guides on Edmunds and TrueCar. You can compare reliability and get reasonable reviews from ConsumerReports, Edmunds, and JD Power. Car blogs suck and only care about pageviews. I'd trust [this guy](http://sujanpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/car-salesman.jpg) more than I would trust blogs. If you know what you want it will speed along your process A LOT. \u000a\u000aFind a dealership with the car you want. \u000a\u000aTell your salesman what is important to you. If someone tells me time is a hot button for them, I will focus on doing things efficiently and quickly. \u000a\u000aGo in the morning. Most people usually shop after work or on weekends so you would want to avoid those high traffic times. The big bottleneck is the finance office at most dealerships. Our guys usually have had their first cup of coffee and are ready to work around 10 or 11. If you come in at 10-10:30 you can be the primary focus of those guys without many customers in front of you. I understand this will not be possible for most people with jobs. \u000a\u000aBring all your paperwork. Insurance and drivers license. If you are trading your current vehicle in bring along any payoff or title information. If you are going to put money down. Have a certified check, card, or cash available. \u000a\u000aIf you want to drive the car, drive it. If you don't a simple "no thanks I already have driven it" will usually work.\u000a\u000aAgree to a price. Do the whole negotiation thing. The less you negotiate the faster it will go. Yes, I am a car salesman. Yes, I am telling you to negotiate less. Take it with a grain of salt. But it IS true. Time spent going back and forth is time not spent driving. \u000a\u000aI have never worked as a finance guy so I can't help you too much there. The best I can say is to figure out if you want GAP, or any other warranties beforehand and stick to that. The finance guy is there to sell warranties. That is how he gets paid. If you know what you want you can reduce a lot of time spent in the finance office. If you waffle, they will take a lot longer to "print" your paperwork and continue to sell to you. \u000a\u000aLet me know if that helps next time.

VHaha ... Tempting but there is a theory that when we hold off to something we desire, we end up enjoying it more. Happened with Fate already. I knew that the LE was coming and that could see it in Youtube but I waited to see it in the game so i kept holding off. I was reading the novel and watching the UBW anime as it was coming out so it took me 2 months to finish UBW and then a couple of weeks to end HF. Finally, I finished the game and it was incredibly satisfying. Felt proud of how much I resisted and it was concordantly with the themes of the LE. That makes it rather special for me. But hey, that is just a preference. Might not turn down as I expect but at least gotta try.

VI've never had much luck with guys. Most boys made fun of me in middle and high school, so I never really had a decent market to choose from. Every guy I liked either didn't care I existed, only liked me as a friend, or was to preoccupied with someone else. When I finally did get dates, they were always guys that I wasn't super into but settled for because I was tired of being lonely. I knew I didn't care about them much, and I always kept an eye out for a better opportunity while with them.\u000a\u000aFast forward to now, I am 24 and have a boyfriend who I am completely and totally in love with. Sure, things may not be perfect but who's relationship is? I feel as though we are meant to be and he completes me, and blah blah you get the point. But there is one huge problem: he wants kids and I don't.\u000a\u000aNow I realize finding a CF guy in my town that is into me and I am into to him is slim to none. Fact is most people want to start a family and I totally get that. I just don't. I am 100% sure about it and I am not changing my mind. \u000a\u000aHe insists he doesn't want to break up because he loves me. He likes to live in the moment. I am concerned about the future. I don't break up with him because I'd like to spend as much time as possible in this relationship because I don't know when or even if I will have another one, especially one where I am this happy. \u000a\u000aBut I don't want to be alone in the long run. I am considering trying to find a childfree dating site or something making a profile and keeping my options open. If I met someone that I'd think I'd like and I could have a future with I might dump my s/o. But the chances of this are small and I figure I will wait until he decides he is ready for kids and breaks up with me. \u000a\u000aI feel bad about this, because I love him and I want only him. But the circumstances aren't in my favor for that. I'm just ready to settle down and find a life partner. I don't like his live in the moment attitude because even though we might get in a car wreck and die tomorrow, I don't like not knowing how my future will be romantically.
p495
sI1
VOh no, moving isn't an option. I lost my job a few months back and don't have the money to move. Plus we signed a lease on the apartment we have and if I break up with him I will not be able to afford rent since all I am doing currently is being a caretaker for an elderly lady. My mom lives in a small camper, I don't speak to my dad and I have no siblings so I'd have no where to go. \u000a\u000aAlso, don't worry. We aren't getting married. I am against marriage. Plus I don't think he would resent me because I told him when he decides he is ready to have kids (which he insists in a good 5-10 years from now) that I am completely okay with him ending the relationship in a non-messy fashion.
p496
sI2
V> Plus I don't think he would resent me because I told him when he decides he is ready to have kids (which he insists in a good 5-10 years from now) that I am completely okay with him ending the relationship in a non-messy fashion.\u000a\u000aHe will resent you, because he is going to expect you to change your mind sometime between now and then, and when you don't he will be extremely resentful of you "wasting his time" so to speak. You're being naive if you think he will just be okay breaking things off after spending yet another 5-10 years in a relationship with you. Perhaps he thinks he is going to change your mind somehow. 
p497
sI3
VI think you are relying to much on the "typical scenario" rather than trusting that I know what my boyfriend wants. He knows I am not changing my mind. He does not expect me to, he wishes more than anything to have a family with  me but he knows I detest children and want nothing to do with the parenting lifestyle. But like I said, he lives entirely in the moment. In his eyes, if he wants kids at 30-35 why end things with me now? We enjoy each other's time, have a healthy sex life, and continue to be happy "playing house" when he has those urges to settle down then we will discuss it and part ways.  Plus he knows he could leave me and go live with his parents, but until I am back on my feet again I'd be homeless if he just left me right now. 
p498

VWell if that is true, then more power to you both and I wish you the best. I hope it all works out, not like the "typical scenario".

p513
sI4
VThanks for that info!  I think it's a shame that OTA will go away at all, no matter how long in the future.  People need access to news and some basic entertainment in this day and age, and some people simply can't even afford basic cable.  They can handle a one-time expense; not a recurring, monthly expense.\u000a\u000aEven those that would argue again "needing" basic entertainment, people simply need the news in this day and age.  They need to know what's going on in their surroundings, at the very least.\u000a\u000a(yeah, I know they could listen to radio if they were desperate)
p514
sI5
Vyeah.. you can't have it where all the news and entertainment requires a cable to your house or a streaming account.. Millions of people can't justify those expenses.. I am pretty much one of them.. I mean I could do basic cable and some that live in mountainous areas have to go with cable or dish.. but OTA has a lot of great shows that end up on cable as reruns...\u000a\u000aI just wish there was a conservative type news station nationally... In many areas OTA broadcasts RT which is Russian Government News and F24 which is French Government News.. and that propaganda is influencing a lot of people that cant afford cable to watch something like CNN or FOXNews or even MSNBC in comparison to Russian Government News RT .. i mean its crazy they even let that company air on US airwaves.. \u000a\u000aOh well heh.. other note .. just figured out if i plug earbuds in my cellphone I can get local FM Radio over the air not streamed....  the app is called NextRadio .. it downloads a tiny bit of data to tell you stations and whats playing now.. but I guess you could probably block it from data because it has a numeric station dial you can scan.

I wanted to make sure that they knew what I did rather than just a generic "Graphic Designer..." \u000a\u000aI appreciate the Resume critique, but I'm going to have to disagree. The resume is showing my work as a designer. I could easily make a simple resume, but it would look like every other resume, besides my color scheme. I don't want to be traditional, it will make me look like everyone else, which is the exact opposite of what I want to do. Also, infographic resumes are a trend right now.\u000a\u000aWebsite critique, its in the early stages of development, [Here is it](http://dev.jonathonjamesdesign.com). I honestly haven't been able to get a REAL critique on it yet, so I've been drifting through space...

VI think the image that has a bit more depth of field allows the type to stand out better. I think they start to compete when too much is in focus.\u000a\u000aYou're certainly entitled to your opinion as am I. I do think others will agree with me on the resume. It's just too much. Very little hierarchy, too cluttered, clunky flow of information, irrelevant rating of your software knowledge. I highly recommend you at least prepare a toned down version on your resume. If you hadn't had told me what it was, I'd have no idea that was your resume. Your resume design isn't what's supposed to stand out, it's the experience and background listed within it that is supposed to make you stand out.\u000a\u000aAs I mentioned before, try and get your hierarchy down. That'll do you wonders. The website certainly holds promise, you just haven't had the chance to really flesh it out yet. It's hard to give you more feedback at the moment.
p520
sI3
V> I do think others will agree with me on the resume.\u000a\u000aI disagree, honestly.\u000a\u000aDesign on a resume can mean just as much as the experience you have as well as your skillset.\u000a\u000aOf course this is relative to where you will be applying and honestly your resume should be changing with just about every place that you are applying to. I can assure you that creative corporations and design firms get tired of seeing 'skilled in photoshop/illustrator/indesign/etc'. It's a give-in that anyone applying for the position of graphic designer *should* be skilled in those areas. Make your resume stand out a bit from the ho-hum, droll pile of resumes.\u000a\u000aIf you're applying for the stereotypical office job, then by all means take the boring resume/cover letter approach.\u000a\u000a\u000aAs for a critique of OP's actual resume: I think the fold out brochure is a neat idea, although I don't necessarily agree with how you've presented the hierarchy of information. I also feel there are too many colors on the sides. Perhaps find a color scheme/accent color and stick with it.

VThank you! Eveything that i've been told is to not make it boring like everything I've seen out there.  \u000a\u000aI agree with the hierarchy issue, this was just the first run through of my design.

VDark Souls is significantly better with a controller, trust me. The only time a keyboard and mouse *might* be better is if you're aiming in first person with a bow. But if you actually have time to use the FPS mode, it's because you're unnoticed by whatever you're aiming at and have all the time in the world to line up your shot anyway.\u000a\u000aDark Souls doesn't require fast paced, twitch aiming. The entire game is a practice of patience and well timed attacks.

VHello guys! I'm currently new at mixing and editing vocals and my problem is that I don't know which is the best way to add effects to your vocal track.\u000a\u000aI have Pro Tools, but I'm currently using Mixcraft because it's a lot easier in my opinion, for beginners. When adding effects, I just use the 'effects rack' on the track settings and add effects there. But sometimes, my vocals would become to 'bulky' or like its really loud and it doesn't sound that natural enough... I heard that professional audio producers uses plugin chain in pro tools like sending/buses and stuffs like-creating separate aux tracks, putting the effects there, and sending your vocal track to that aux track... which is kind of difficult for me.\u000a\u000aWhat do you guys suggest? Which would sound better?\u000a\u000aBTW I'm using eq, compression, de-esser, etc... basic effects and all... Thanks!
p571
sI1
VWhile this is generally right, having reverbs and delays on individual tracks is more flexible. For example, you might want a long reverb on the snare and a much shorter one on the kick. You might also want a mono reverb on the snare and kick and a stereo one on the toms and overheads. You might want a different delay on a doubled vocal, etc. Bussing verbs and delays definitely conserves resources, but it limits choices.
p572
sI2
VI've never wanted different reverb on any of my recordings, unless it was for a special effect. Having different verbs in a mix can be offputting. 
p573
sI3
VTo each his own. However, my example holds. If you have a dry kick that needs some room, sending it to a long, stereo plate reverb that was optimized for the voice and guitars is going to sound bad. The center image of the kick will get smeared and you will have a bunch of low end clutter in the verb.  But like I said, everyone has their own thing.
p574
sI4
VAbsolutely. You know what you're doing. The OP does not. \u000a\u000aI've had too many sessions come across my desk where there was a delay and reverb on each track, set to different things. Someone new to the craft should learn to buss these effects, and then they'll learn to use them for nuanced effect correctly.

VI'm using MinGW w64 5.0 in CLion for the code. Before I updated it to MinGW w64 5.0, I was using MinGW w32 4.8.1-4. I updated to I would have access to the stoi and stod functions.\u000a\u000aRegardless, my teacher has noted that "const string& s = string()" gives "string s" optional parameters. After updating, it began giving me an error on 5.0 (const string and const__numpunct_cache are not compatible).\u000a\u000aWhat is the difference between the two setups? Benefits of one over the other?\u000a\u000a[Here is my code on Drive.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1z6vdDnW-PhM04tVG1KRkoxRm8/view?usp=sharing)

p587
sI2
VI'm a bit confused what you're trying to accomplish. Anything defined as `const string& str;` will be read-only, but based on the fields you have above, I assume you want to change these values once you know the student's name. Furthermore, if you are reading input parameters into a string within a class, why wouldn't you use a `string` type instead of a reference to a string? I.e.\u000a\u000a    class Student {\u000a    private:\u000a        string first;\u000a        string last;\u000a        ...\u000a    \u000a    public:\u000a        Student(string f, string l) {\u000a            first = f;\u000a            last = l;\u000a            ...\u000a        }\u000a    ...\u000a    }\u000a\u000aBeyond that, if I had to choose between the two examples you used, I would probably go with `const string& first = string();`. But I'm not sure under what situation this code would be relevant.
p588

VSo first off, I know I'm the bad guy in this story. All my actions for a while have been pretty much solely geared towards preserving my own sanity, and I was completely callous about severing ties. I should have handled this completely differently, but I didn't have the presence of mind or words to communicate how I was feeling without seeming to place the blame on others.\u000a\u000aBackground: I am, and have always been, extremely bad at dealing with stress, both social and academic. When I entered college, I had a minor breakdown, spent an entire year silently doing my homework and keeping my head down, speaking to no one. It was tough getting through that year without friends (I lost contact with my high school crowd quite quickly), but also sort of liberating. I felt a lot safer without being vulnerable to anyone except my family, who are always easy to talk to.\u000a\u000aThe next year, I got my act together, felt more comfortable intellectually and reached out to the other girl in my program, Jane. We had a lot in common and bonded over shared tastes and imposter syndrome. My acquaintance with her brought me into a group of extremely high-achieving people in my discipline, including my current boyfriend, Charlie. Every single one of them was brilliant, fun, and attractive, and I felt so lucky to have infiltrated a group of people who were my superiors in every way. \u000a\u000aI got such an ego/confidence boost from being liked and sought-after by these people, I didn't notice some things that would later make me uncomfortable: these people, who had never known weakness or imperfection, were quite unforgiving of other people's failings, and the gossip often lacked empathy. The other problem was the tightness of the group; social interaction was expected 4-5 times a week, which tired introverted, curmudgeonly me. Jane, especially, expected me to be frequently available, which became difficult to balance when I started dating Charlie. She often got judgmental about her friends' romantic choices, especially if she perceived the SOs to be less worthy or to be stealing her friends' time from her. I understand this, of course, but since Charlie was an old friend of hers, I often feared being in that line of fire.\u000a\u000aAt the end of last school year, almost everyone in the group left for grad school, leaving only Charlie, Jane, and I hanging out together. We made a few new friends, but it was still often just the three of us. At the same time, my old insecurities came back in full force. I was taking four upper-division classes in my major per quarter, I was tired, inadequate to the task, and trying to balance my first romantic relationship on top of it all. \u000a\u000aMy depression returned, worse than before, and I started to feel horribly unworthy of everything I had, especially my perfect, functional boyfriend. Social interactions left me drained and sad, and the only people with whom I felt comfortable were Charlie and my family. With Jane, I always felt badly about myself after speaking to her, since our insecurities resonated and were exacerbated by her company, rather than improved. Further, sometimes when I felt especially low, I would cancel plans with her (scummy, I know). Her reactions often made me feel so guilty that I stopped taking any pleasure in her company at all. For about a quarter after I reached this point, I tried to maintain the friendship and force interactions, but by April I realized that I couldn't keep it up without tearing myself apart. Spending time around an absolutely prefect girl (an improvement on me in every way) who spoke so often of grades and grad school, and who so often professed such a low opinion of her friends' choices was just untenable for me.\u000a\u000aI'm not proud of it, but my solution was to quit the relationship entirely. I made excuses for every invitation and did not answer texts or make eye contact in our classes. I stayed with Charlie. I'm not sure how I can really justify that, but I love him and he helps me. I've told him he'd be better off without me, but he disagrees and I'm getting better at accepting that. I'm sure everyone here will condemn me for staying with him in my current state, but I don't think my decision on that front will change.\u000a\u000aSo life has gone on, me quite alone, but feeling better about it. There have been times when I feel horrible about not having many friends, but it's so much easier to work and focus on my hobbies, I think my life is better for it. Charlie and Jane and other members of the group are still friends (the source of endless insecurity for me, which I am working on controlling), and next year Jane and I will, again, be in all the same classes. I know from Charlie that Jane feels very hurt and wronged by me, and that she wants to be friends again. But honestly, I don't want to go back. Since severing our friendship, I've heard through the grapevine that she tells people (who dislike me) how "worried" she is about me. Maybe I'm wrong to take offense, but the idea of her using my mental illness as gossip repulses me. I don't think I trust her enough to be her friend. \u000a\u000aI would, however, like to decrease the tension, if that's possible. I was considering a letter consisting of a (highly distilled and non-accusatory) account of why I felt unable to continue the friendship and an apology for dropping away so abruptly. Would this help her, or just cause drama?\u000a\u000a**tl;dr**: I faded out of a close friendship when I got depressed last year, and am currently feeling better but not inclined to resume the friendship. Should I explain myself, or let sleeping dogs lie?
p601

VI guess my problem is that I really don't want to open the door for some kind of dramatic climax. Do you think a good "peace offering" would be a letter? Just an apologetic message on facebook?
p602
sI2
VWhy do you think it would be dramatic? Send her a message apologize for how you handled the situation and that you aren't ready to be friends again. Would it be less dramatic to do it face to face the next time you see her in a class? I would think that would give you a lot more anxiety than messaging her or a email/letter. You know you hurt her feelings and mistreated her, just own up to it and apologize. It's not like she will suddenly start a fight over it or something. I guess I don't understand what kind of drama you expect?
p603
sI3
VOh, I wasn't debating doing it in person. That would be ridiculous.\u000a\u000aNo, what I worry about is an argument, the letter getting sent to other members of the group and bringing them into it, or Jane bringing it up to Charlie and him getting stuck in the middle. I don't think it's implausible that a letter would make her likely to respond angrily. And if she were to respond, I don't know if I'd be obligated to continue the discussion of if I could just be silent.\u000a\u000aI guess the cowardly part of me just wants to let the whole thing be and continue in silence, but that seems wrong.
p604
sI4
VI agree it would be cowardly to continue to ignore it. If you don't want it sent to others digitally, send her a hand written letter. Along with an apology, explain that you won't communicate with her again but you just want to acknowledge that you had wronged her. If she hasn't gone out of her way to confront you now or draw you boyfriend into it, i doubt she would if you make it clear you aren't interested in drawing anything out. I'm glad you considering reaching out to her though to apologize. That is the right thing to do considering she really didn't do anything to deserve that treatment.

That said, they probably aren't as transparent as they should be.  \u000a\u000aJust another note: when I say "Federal Contractors are barred from contributing" - this means that, for example, Boeing *The Corporation and anyone with Contract Development positions* are barred from contributing.  Individual employees - such as myself - may contribute unless (again) i'm in some sort of procurement/CD position.  \u000a\u000aThe Supreme Court has barred all federal contractors from contributing, but has said employees of a contractor may still contribute up to the personal maximum.  It was determined banning employees from contributing would be too limiting on freedom of speech.  \u000a\u000aHOWEVER - this is why you see professional lobbyists donating max amounts to candidates - you can bet that gets written off *somehow*.  Probably in the form of bonuses.

VLobbying is not pure evil, but "special interests" being elevated through litigation at the expense of the taxpayer is frequently traced back to aggressive lobbying and cloak and dagger dark money. That's why I agree that lobbying is dangerous as is, but that the Stat in the article is meaningless.

VMy coaches have been including lefty backhands (I'm right handed btw) into our throwing drills during practice and it got me thinking, why would I ever really bother throwing a lefty backhand? I can reach out further with a regular flick and it's a higher percentage throw because I already have a well developed flick.
p622
sI1
V[This breakdown](http://www.pulleddisc.com/space-and-angles-in-stubbs-lean-lefty/) of that lefty from Stubbs is even more illuminating on the utility of the lefty backhand as compared to a flick.\u000a\u000aIn the Vandervoort example, his pivot seems to indicate that his left is his dominant throwing hand...not sure how applicable that clip is to this particular question.\u000a\u000aIn general, my personal attitude is to ask, "why not?" instead of "why?" when it comes to developing a new throw. Any new capability makes me more versatile/dangerous with the disc in my hands.

VI know a lot of people didn't like the fact that Ornstein came back for round 2 in Dark Souls 2, and I understand why, but why do other things like this get a free pass? Don't get me wrong, I love Patches, the Moonlight Greatsword, "Praise the Sun," etc., but I don't get why those things can come back and people just accept it but when Ornstein comes back everyone gets mad about "fanservice." I thought the fight with the Old Dragonslayer was great personally, and it helped sorta bid towards the origins of Heide.\u000a\u000aReally I guess what I'm asking is why does everyone want important, lore-related weapons to come back and even whole characters, but no bosses?
p636
sI1
V>There's no real attempt to make Patches or Moonlight significant in the lore, and they're clearly inside jokes. \u000a\u000aI'd argue that lore-wise, there were some interesting implications for both of those in Bloodborne, more so than in their other appearances. Maybe I'm alone in feeling that way though, who knows
p637
sI2
VI guess the MLG was somewhat relevant in regards to Ludwig. The point I probably should have made, was that neither of them contradict the lore of any of the games they're in. The Old Dragonslayer is either Ornstein, or someone pretending to be Ornstein. Ornstein still existing doesn't make any sense since we defeated him in DS1. So if he's an imitator, then where did this guy get almost identical armor from? and why does he have an almost identical moveset? And why is there a dragon outside his boss room in SotFS? \u000a\u000aThe fact that all of these questions exist leads me to believe that the inclusion of the Old Dragonslayer wasn't fully thought out and put in as lazy fan service. But that's just my impression.
p638
sI3
VDaS2 certainly doesn't consistently have the level of nuance in its environmental narrative as the other Souls games, and possibly the best example of it is Old Dragonslayer. So I definitely hear you there. I felt very, very ripped off that SotFS didn't address things like that, but particularly stuff more directly relevant to the story like the Giants and the Throne, or the overall goal of the Children of Dark. A sorely missed opportunity, for sure.
p639
sI4
VYeah, I feel like there was a lot of interesting ideas in DS2, but none of them were really developed upon enough. Then again, this is probably due to the erratic development cycle of the game.

VSo you're saying Chara wanted to kill humans?
p644
sI2
VHonestly, I'm not for an absolutely innocent Chara. I'm mostly here for laughs and good fanart, so I will say Chara clearly did not like humanity. After falling in the Underground, they grew accustomed to a loving family, an environment they weren't used to, and tried to make the most of it. They knew they could use the situation to get back at humanity and aid the people that showed them kindness. In a sense, Chara would need to kill to show their appreciation, which is a very twisted world-view. Poor Chara. In this way it is that Chara wanted the deaths of a few humans. ^(I admit!)\u000a\u000aBut all these interpretations on Chara's part were never their fault as it dealt entirely with their crummy surface life. Chara technically didn't do wrong if it was the only way they knew how.
p645
sI3
VI like to dick around here, but this story to me is about Asriel breaking out of an abusive relationship. \u000a\u000aI think it's resonable to assume Chara wanted Asriel to kill humans from a few of the following clues though. \u000a\u000a-came to the underground for a "not good reason" implying they tried killing themselves\u000a\u000a-strongly hated humanity. Asriel said that when it's clearly seen he tried buttercoating everything\u000a\u000a-Asriel when being as nice as possible says Chara wasn't the greatest person (Personal note: I really hate it when people point to him claiming you're the only one who understands it's only because he's the only person he has known that isn't just an answer or aka not resettable)\u000a\u000a-Chara was described as his best friend, but Asriel says Frisk is the friend he always wanted. Aka not as good of a person. \u000a\u000a-Asriel said Chara wanted to use their full power \u000a\u000a-It's implied that Asriel had to resist that temptation and why he felt like it was a terrible decion as it created his Kill or be killed \u000a\u000aIf you take all of this into consideration Chara not valuing their life tried killing themselves and convinced Asriel to take his soul, which is why Chara had Asriel turn off his camera when trying to tell him his plan to "free" them and used their influence to have Asriel deal back pain onto humans that they had given to them, but didn't expect Asriel to pull out of the cituation and thought humans attacking him would provoke him enough into start killing, and as we know from love, the more you start to kill the easier it is to separate yourself and make you hate them more. Yes I do agree the surface probably messed up Chara, but it seems like Chara took advantage of Asriel his family for his own sadistic agenda against the humans.  \u000a
p646
sI4
V>-came to the underground for a "not good reason" implying they tried killing themselves\u000a\u000aIt's worth noting that Chara trips over a vine in the intro instead of jumping on purpose, along with there being multiple lines about how they had a glimmer of hope (aka *Determination*) in their eyes and stuff like that. All that put together means there's heavy evidence they didn't come to die.
p647
sI5
VFine but Chara let themselves die to do everything else and let Asriel absorb his soul can show how "determined" he was to have Asriel go to the surface. Nothing implies that Chara was doing this for the right thing, when you have a track record of being naughty and bad, and then you decide to kill yourself for a noble cause doesn't add up

I explained that her TV could only show a quarter of the screen's pixels, and that this picture was four times sharper.\u000a\u000aCut to yesterday when I met her again for lunch and she was telling me about all the ads she was going through--online and offline--to look for a 4k TV. I haven't seen her fixated on anything like that before, and she mentioned to me that all the ads were for 1080p or 1440p televisions but she was determined to find one. She also made a comment about how her TV "just looks blurry now" compared to the 4k one.\u000a\u000aMy mom isn't tech savvy by any means but she's slowly making progress.

Any of you guys in the enterprise/K-12/Higher ed spaces have any dealings with Juniper or Aruba right now?

VWe're replacing our Cisco kit because most of it's well past EoL and we're hitting some significant performance and functionality issues. We're not going for Cisco as a replacement primarily due to cost but also because their network security strategy is a mess. Security group tagging is a great idea but it's not supported on all their kit plus it's proprietary. Their firewall strategy was far from clear as well. And we have been screwed over to many times by Cisco licencing problems.\u000a\u000aWe're not replacing the Bluesocket stuff primarily because a) we're happy with it already, and b) we haven't found anything that would suit us better. \u000a\u000aThe Bluesocket VWLAN controllers run as virtual machines and centralise authentication, management etc. But unlike traditional controller/LWAP implementations, the client traffic (other than auth etc) isn't tunneled to the controller so the controller doesn't end up being a bottleneck. It works well for us with >1,200 APs across a university campus all running on two virtual controllers. Bluesocket's not got the latest and greatest 802.11ac radios but it suits our user population.

VStill knowing the GPU would be helpful. Do you know how old it is and it is a low, mid, or top tier? How much VRAM? What maker(AMD, NVIDIA)? General performance in the games you play?

The new cards will most likely be only top tier, mid tier to follow by the end of the year or next year.\u000a\u000aNo HDD needed? What case? This is also important in parts selections(can limit the MB, GPU, PSU, and CPU cooler).

VI am still expecting only the top tier GPUs to be announced at the conference. No real telling when they will release them or the price till then. I haven't checked in a few day so I could be wrong already, maybe something leaked.\u000a\u000aConsidering you already have a GPU you think will work, you can by the other parts now and once the new GPUs start rolling out you can see if it is worth it to upgrade.\u000a\u000aI should mention that the CPU is also available at Newegg for the same price. That will keep you at only two sources for parts. Still recommend getting the ram from amazon with their 2 day free delivery.

VHello all,\u000a\u000aI am currently a Junior Chemistry major/ biochem minor at a recognized liberal arts college and I have a few questions regarding possible summer research.  I am wondering if it would be worth applying to REU programs.  Science GPA = 2.44 and Cumm GPA = 2.86.  I know my GPA is low, but I am very much looking into getting some experience under my belt before applying to grad school. Also, if any of you have other ideas, please holler.  Thanks all!

VTaking the risk of being downvoted to oblivion, I'd like to share some random thoughts about the "friend and ally" thing. \u000aI was actually thinking that this painting was made by Charles during his therapy sessions in Radley OR by his therapist. There's a lot of drawings in this show: Bethany's sketchbook, Wren's paintings... what if Charles' therapist was actually a psycho who treated him as his pet project and induced the idea of revenge in him, maybe using Charles as a projection of his own self and something he had suffered during adolescence? Now, when Charles is breaking down and trying to reconnect with his siblings, his therapist is reminding him about the whole deal, hence the gift package. But who could be this strange persona? Wren is obviously too young. Dr Sullivan? Maybe pastor Ted acted as spiritual counselor in Radley?

VNo she's incredibly strong. She may not be meta, and may be able to be shut down at higher elos because of exhaust and coordinated CC, but she's strong. \u000a\u000aHighest base AD in the game, high early game burst, invulnerability burst ult, 2x 500 range gap closers and one of the highest AS steroids in the game.\u000a
p761
sI2
VAlright well I guess I should rephrase that. I never seen to have trouble when I play against her. Personally I don't find her strong and don't think she is nearly as viable as other champs. Obviously she can be good when fed, but she never seems to get that way in any of my games.
p762
sI3
VCould you tell me good lane matchups or overall good champions against her. Apart from Jax who will never be open. Also I played skarner and seemed to have quite a bit of success ulting her and bursting her down, but when the team didn't follow we lost:-( \u000a
p763

VI play a ton of renekton and basically never get beat. Renekton is a pretty huge lane bully though. Ialso play aatrox which usually goes fairly well. Im not much of a top laner though. I tend to jungle and support alot. That being said I don't know a ton of matchups that beat her. I assume you could play something like lulu if you wanted to be annoying and poke her down. Thats really all i have. Really all you need is some decent form of cc to stop he if she gets fed, then once she uses ult she is useless. Thats my opinion though, im sure others could give better and more accurate advice.

VEvery other post I read that are about something "important" the players start by saying "I AM DIAMOND 1 HURPA DURPA"\u000a\u000aThis is not something that i personally thinks has even the slightest weight on how much they know about certain matters, sometimes i have so many valid arguments that their whole post is unvalid. And I have friends, who play in "Diamond1" who knows much less about stuff than me(gold1). Some people only plays 1 champion and automatically is considered good at this game because they reached diamond with it. \u000a\u000aThen i see them go 2/15 with Ryze or something they are not familiar with. Blames the champion and not themselves. Whatever. \u000a\u000aTLDR; Diamond 1-bomb is not something that automatically makes you smarter than everyone.

VSo, what rank are you? Do you know the smaller details like wave manipulation, baiting the enemy to auto you once at lvl 1 so their wave will push so you can safely farm at tower without having to buy a ward?\u000a  \u000aMechanics don't really equate to the majority of this game. By the time people hit goldish they understand the basic mechanics of trading damage and csing. \u000a  \u000aWhy you have a grudge against Diamond 1 players I have no idea. But if you aren't hitting Diamond 1 you most likely don't understand this game as much as them. I don't know if you got butthurt by random Diamond players in the past or if you just want to believe you are "smarter than them" which doesn't matter if you are considering smarts out of game.\u000a  \u000aI hope you get rid of this negative attitude you have.

Vhaha I win almost every lane i face so yea. Those are just basics in laning for me. Predicting ganks. \u000a\u000aYou don't have to be diamond 1 for these things. And no. I've never been "butthurt" by a diamond 1. But it's the pedistal attitude from em i can't handle. \u000a\u000aLike yours.

VAs someone who's studied psychology and behavior I hope you do better in the future.\u000a  \u000aThe very first message I posted and your "debate" saying that there was something wrong with "great knowledge" showed how you already got annoyed for word choice. \u000a  \u000aIf you don't keep the chip off of your shoulder debating anything is pointless as you will set tones to things that were never meant in the way you interpret it.\u000a  \u000aGood day :)

VI had never heard of that, but it looks amazing. If he is the sort to carry a bunch of keys around, I bet he'd love it. You mentioned a straight razor earlier, so a good shaving related gift may be a double edged safety razor, in case he doesn't have his strop handy. Personally, one of my favorite razors is [this](http://www.fendrihan.com/merkur-slant-sledgehammer-doubleedge-safety-razor-p-173.html). If you combine that with some [Mitchell's Wool Fat Shaving Soap](http://www.amazon.com/Mitchells-Wool-Shave-Soap-Bowl/dp/B0006NXP9E) would combine with gifts he already has to make for a very thoughtful anniversery gift. What do you think? Or do we need some more options?
p778
sI4
VWoops! I mis-typed earlier and he has [this](http://www.fendrihan.com/merkur-futur-adjustable-safety-razor-satin-finish-p-62.html) not a straight razor. And the last gift did include soap so I wouldn't want a repeat of last year's gift. Although good ideas! 
p779
sI5
VNo worries! For the record, I'd save the link to the soap though for a later date, the stuff is MAGIC! Is he into writing? A fountain pen and a leather journal would be wonderful- assuming he is into that sort of thing. I find journaling VERY therapeutic. If he does as well, check out [Levenger](http://www.levenger.com/PAGETEMPLATES/NAVIGATION/Preview.asp?Params=category=8-831|level=2-3) and try and find a fountain pen there. They have a wide range of options, so it should be easy to find one that fits your budget. Barnes and Noble sells some nice leather journals for about twenty bucks, so that could easily be bundled with it. Would he be interested in that/would you want to give that?

VHow can I find an Origin Valley biome? Seeds don't work because I have a custom modpack and I'm not quite sure which ones effect terrain generation.

VNo guarantee that it's always the same wasp. For example, if it dies, a new wasp instantly replaces it. Also, since it's just a wasp, it won't have any other special characteristics other than it's the wasp that stays near you at all times. So you can't befriend it, have a conversation with it, etc. It's just a wasp like any other.

VStill sticking with the wasp. As long as it didn't sting me it wouldn't really bother me much, and would be hilarious how much it bothered other people. \u000a\u000aOf course there's the risk of being ostracized from my friends and family due to their uncomfort around unruly wasps, but that's still better than the other option. \u000a\u000aI must say OP, you have a sick sick mind that you're able to think up two things so horribly annoying.

V> Still sticking with the wasp. As long as it didn't sting me it wouldn't really bother me much, and would be hilarious how much it bothered other people\u000a\u000aI appreciate your enthusiasm and fortitude, but I must reinforce the fact that there is nothing special about this wasp, other than it is always within 15 feet of you. So if you piss it off, inadvertently swat it, make it jealous by going near its wasp lady friend, etc; you are liable to get stung. Just like it was any other wasp.
p815
sI4
VYeah I get that, but having grown up in a neighborhood with lots of wasps (the insects AND the people) I've gotten pretty good at not getting stung by them. \u000a\u000aI'm confident that I'd be okay. Maybe the odd time in the night it would land on me and I'd roll over on it and it would sting. So I guess it would suck having it indoors.

VI also prefer a "keep inventory" style, but for different reasons; lag. Sure, 99.9% of players know better, but\u2026 well, the whitelist-only  server I play on still gets a griefer or two each year. Stuff happens. Never-despawning items just seems like it's asking for trouble.
p819
sI2
Vwe are talking about named items, the griefer has to be dedicated to achieve something with that rule. like he needs access to a an xp farm and to an iron farm, because he is going to need 1 level for each item that he names and he is going to use a lot of anvils if he plans on droping 10000 items in the floor or something like that. also, is super boring to do and is very hard to hurt the server using that method vs just using tnt or something like that.\u000athey could lag big servers, but solving it would be easy, just delete all the items in the world once a day with a command or a plugin and you are set.\u000a\u000athat being said, maybe never despawning items are too op, i would say that named items should stay longer in the ground, like maybe 20 minutes? is 4x more time than regular items, if you really want to recover those items 20 minutes is more than enough time.
p820
sI3
VNope, only one level per 64 items if you do it by the stack.  That's only 157 levels for 10000 items, and that is very achievable if you are at an enderman farm and constantly naming items.
p821
sI4
Vyou are right, but the griefer is still going to need access to the enderman farm and do more things in the process, and he needs to make 4 trips or so from end to overworld renaming items and putting them in chest... is just not worth it, i mean, if i am a griefer i can think of funnier ways to cause trouble. and even if people are bored enough to do it, is very easy for admins to fix the issue, with an item clear, something that is already implemented in big servers, usually clearing all the items in the world every 10 minutes or so giving a 1 minute warning before.\u000a\u000aanyway as i have said, never despawning is op for the survival gamemode, but extended lifetime for named items could be a good feature and i makes certain sense, named mobs dont despawn, so named items should also be harder to despawn

p828
sI4
VThat should work.  I prefer to keep the devices in the audio chain to a minimum, but using a computer helps with most potential loudness issues because of the integrated mixer.  It you get any signal clipping, you may need to adjust the audio output on the tv to line out instead of headphone out.  Most tvs have this option now.

VWell to make a long story short I was a 4 year every single day drinker (90% beer) from 20-24. Went to rehab last year and made it about 60 to 70 days before my first drink. \u000a\u000aThe time from out of rehab to now has been awesome. I got out and sky rocketed through life quickly. Good job. Awesome apartment in downtown Seattle. \u000a\u000aBut it is all about to come to a end. I am drinking a fifth a day of hard liquor now from sun up to sleep. I go to work drinking. I wish I could say drunk but I do not think its even possible for me to get drunk at this point. \u000a\u000aI work in sales and do not drink at all. That is the reason I can drink pretty much 24/7 and not have to worry about wrecking a car or hurting someone. I am a very calm person even when drinking. I doubt anyone would even realize I had been drinking. \u000a\u000a\u000aWell I have now exhausted pretty much all of my money. Paid my rent today. Have about 800$ remaining in my bank. It will not last. I need help but I am going to lose everything if I go to rehab again or even detox. \u000a\u000aI do not know what to do. I have done this to my self. I knew what was going to happen if I took that drink. I have really fucked up. \u000a\u000a\u000aWell... I do not know guys. Please if you are sober stay sober.\u000a\u000a\u000aSorry for the rant but I am done. \u000a\u000aEdit: I know this is very poorly worded. I am pretty stressed and did it in a very short period of time. I am going to try my hardest to taper down to far less drinks and then try to cold turkey it.

VI was just recently reminded of this story by another hitchhiking story on here. My dad used to tell me and my brother all sorts of stories from his youth hitchhiking down the east coast. There are two that have always really stuck with me and I figured if you guys like this one I'll post the other one.\u000a\u000aWhen my dad was 15 he left home in Massachusetts and hitchhiked down to Florida where his older sister was living in Daytona. This event apparently happened on this trip somewhere in Virginia. He had been trying to hitch a ride outside of some city though he could never remember which one (this happened in 1976 and there were a lot of drugs done between then and now) and this really nice car stopped and picked him up.  \u000a\u000aHe and the driver  get to talking and the guy tells my dad that he is a surgeon at one of the local hospitals, gives him a business card and tells him if he ever needs anything at that hospital to give them his name. All is going well and he is apparently heading pretty far south for some family function so its a long way that my dad doesn't have to walk. He seems like a nice professional guy, clean cut and well spoken. Then shit starts to get weird (my dad's exact wording at this part of the story every time he tells it).\u000a\u000aThe doctor starts giving my dad the side-eye and seems like he wants to say something but can't quite figure out how to say it. Of course my dad is just sort of ignoring him because as he says "I had been on the road for a while and hadn't had a shower or change in clothes in weeks". Then the guy finally comes out and says it.\u000a\u000a"Can I suck your dick?"\u000a\u000aMy dad was obviously taken aback by this and tells him no.\u000a\u000a"Please, just let me suck it a little."\u000a\u000a"No"\u000a\u000a"I'll give you fifty bucks if you let me suck your dick"\u000a\u000a"No!"\u000a\u000a"How about you just let me see it. Can I see it?"\u000a\u000a"No. I think you had better let me off here."\u000a\u000aAnd surprisingly the guy does. He pulls off at a rest stop and lets my dad out. Before he pulls away though he hands my dad that fifty bucks and tells him, "Sorry about that man, I hope I didn't blow your mind or anything".\u000a\u000aThis isn't super creepy but I thought you guys might like it. My dad always said the guy didn't seem like a bad guy, just really messed up and honestly sorry to have freaked him out so bad. I have no way of knowing if it is totally true except that my aunt says my dad told her the same story when he got to Florida a few weeks later.

Prior to the fasted bloodwork I (like an idiot, I guess) pinned 100 mg test prop on Monday and 0.5 mg arimidex, 50 mg Tuesday, and then got the bloodwork on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aI didn't think it'd have THAT immediate of an effect? How does it all look? Seems like the gear is potent, came from an UGL\u000a\u000aEDIT: I know I need to be consistent so EOD 150 MG test prop henceforth, thanks :) And [see](http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/1mpn03/lab_results_baseline_can_you_interpret_if_okay/ccbf235) this post.

VThat's why I quoted it lol. I (at first) didn't think it was necessary because I completely felt fine prior to first pin. Then I read it takes about 2 weeks for prop to hit you, so I thought 2 pins was okay to get a relative baseline. Either this gear is really potent, or my test is naturally high, or a combination of the two?\u000a\u000aAlso, since my test is high, why don't I feel its effects yet on day 4?

I was thinking about asking him(whoever is selling to guy I know) to meet me in the parking lot of a closed down establishment, getting in my car and exchanging. I was going to buy an eighth.

sI2
VIt may be better in a parking lot of an actual functioning business as it would be a lot less suspicious looking if you are seen by anyone. And make sure you have the correct amount of money they want, don't expect change or anything. It's worth asking what they charge beforehand. It may seem novice, but it's a good question since prices can vary person to person and they *may* give you a deal for the first buy from them. Bring a backup zip lock in case they don't have a baggie, this actually happened to me multiple times with my last dealer. Don't talk much, stick to the business. You could lead of with a 'hey, so $(whatever price)? And then they can confirm and you fork it over. They hand you bud, you say thanks man. Then scoot. If you're driving home, obviously obey all laws, speed limits, turn signals, etc. to the point. Never break two laws at once :) any other questions, feel free

VDon't stress over it too much. The guy sells weed so you don't have to act to secretive to him. Just text him whatever, arrange anything that needs to be arranged and it will go fine.  It's a much greater risk to sell than to buy so if he is cool with everything you should be too. Good luck :)

Long story short: i am currently 19 year old and finished first year of university.. recently (about 9-10 months ago) i was just browsing around on Facebook and found this profile of really adorable guy (he is 19y/o too), we are of same age but we are in different countries and i really wanted to talk to him. But since, i am not courageous enough to do so and nor have i ever creep-ed on someone like that before. I never really bothered adding him or messaging. But i keep going back to his Facebook and seeing his picture makes me feel happy for some reason. I always wonder what type of person he might be.\u000awhat should i do Reddit? Should i take a risk and message him? Even though its just physical attraction and i know that i am not going to get anything out of this since we live in different countries.\u000a\u000a\u000aI wonder if anyone of you ever had crush on someone on Facebook without knowing them in person. If so what did you guys do?

VI just treat it like a normal conversation, usually. But you've got the advantage of being a girl: guys almost *universally* enjoy it when a chick randomly compliments them. In fact, if you started the conversation on the pretext that he's hot, he'll most likely be incredibly flattered. Then you'll not only have an easy conversation with him, but you'll see him at his best and most confident because he won't be trying to actively impress you.

VHi, I recently decided to reinstall wow after a long hiatus due to being upgraded to War lords of Draenor for free. After going on Battle net to install the client i noticed that in the area that shows my account, it states:\u000aYOUR GAME ACCOUNTS\u000aWORLD OF WARCRAFT®\u000aWorld of Warcraft® : Warlords of Draenor\u2122\u000a[*******] Standard Edition Time Expired\u000aEurope (EU)\u000a World of Warcraft®\u000a[WoW1] Starter Edition Active\u000aKorea (KR)\u000a \u000aThe second account shows Korea and i did not create it, after googling it seems that perhaps i got hacked. so what should i do now? i've changed my password but is there anything else i need to do. will I be banned once i try and go on, will all my items and gold be gone? i'm currently installing so i haven't found these things out yet.\u000athanks for the help and time.

VFollowing Del Rio's cash in (and the fact it looks like he is going to be offered up as yet another sacrifice for Super Cena to gobble up immediately after winning)  I got thinking about the whole money in the bank concept and I'm not sure if I think it's a good thing...\u000a\u000alooking back at previous money in the bank winners they have often been people who I have really wanted to see elevated to the main event scene.  Guy's like Edge, CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, Miz and Jack Swagger have always led to me being pretty stoked about the potential of them being given a run with the title.  Until it happened. Looking Back when these guys have cashed in money in the bank it's always lead to a brief title reign (normally with them being booked as a piss weak champion).  It's got to the point where winning the MITB will get you a run but not one where you are taken seriously.  I don't think anyone who has cashed in money in the bank has really used it to cement their place in the title picture.  Sure some of them have managed to become fully fledged main eventers, but only after a couple of years of working hard to elevate themselves properly and winning a title at a later date.  I think Miz is a perfect example of this as his cash in led to him having one of the longest title reigns in recent memory.  He got a (admittedly weak as hell) win in a wrestlemania main event.  What happened after he lost the title? dropped straight out of the main event scene. Loses clean to Alex Riley and falls into obscurity. That's without even mentioning what happened to swagger. I'm interested in what everyone thinks on this.  Does money in the bank actually elevate anyone? is it a good thing? or is it just a waste of time that spoils the momentum of rising stars instead of propelling them to superstardom? 
p924
sI1
VI agree, I don't want it to come across like I'm knocking his title run, I'm just frustrated with how he's been buried since then
p925
sI2
Vagreed. I mean, he headlined mania. and now he's doing subway promos. It's a shame
p926
sI3
VHe'll be back in the title picture before long.  Of all the MitB winners, I feel like he's the most likely to bounce back.  He's not going to be doomed to Super Stars like Swagger.  Plus, cashing in worked out just fine for Edge and CM Punk.  They weren't immediately main event guys, hell, Punk was kind in a lull from his 3rd WHC to his first WWE title.  Things will turn around sooner or later.

VSo here I was at Christmas dinner with my gf's parents. \u000aI was enjoying myself until the conversation shifted to me.\u000a\u000aGf's mum: so what are your hobbies (guardian)?\u000a\u000aMy gf plays video games so the parents do try to understand and try to pretend to have an interest in gaming.\u000aI tell them the usual things (jogging reading etc..), I purposly avoid the topic of gaming because I'm a 20+ year old and through out my life i have been shamed for it.\u000a\u000aGf's dad: (gf) tells us your into gaming.\u000a(silence)\u000a\u000aMe:'yea, yeah I game.

About 15 minutes into it i realised they know my real hobby. They seemed overwhelmed and are probably thinking 'god not another low life...(probably not)'\u000a\u000a\u000aBut after dinner, as I was heading to the bathroom getting ready for bed. I walked past my gf's dads office and saw him on Destiny's web page.\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat? What is this? Could I have just converted a man to join the guardians in the stars?

I am running twice a week after dinner, while doing a strentgh programme (convict conditioning) on mondays and fridays. Due to my work, i have irregular eating habits and i sometimes have no time to eat during lunch. I do cook pretty healthy and fresh food every night though. My work also cuts into my sleeping time, reuslting in 6-7 hours of sleep each night. I am also a bit prone to injuries due to a bad knee, which sometimes gives me small aches during running.\u000a\u000aIs this normal or should i have been expected to have made more progress by now?

VSo what inspired this post was that I recently bought *The Legend of Heroes: Trails In The Sky* on Steam. It was my first new JRPG in years (I replay some old ones sometimes, because I'm super nostalgic), and while it's not perfect it scratches a very large itch. I realized, on playing it, that this sort of game has been really absent from my life for a long time, and I miss certain qualities it offers that I don't think any other sort of game does. I'll try to list them here. I think it's particularly important to bring these up because modern game design has given us the impression that several of them are obsolete or even bad, and consequently we're overlooking their advantages. (I recognize that there are exceptions to most of what I'm going to say, but I think it all holds true generally. I don't think naming particular recent games that involve one or more of these will change that. I'm hoping for more substantive reaction or critique.)\u000a\u000aTo be clear, I'm talking about traditional, turn-based, plot-heavy JRPGs, as opposed to strategy, action, dungeon crawler, or any sort of hybrid, all of which are still relatively common. \u000a\u000a* **Room to breathe**: Combat in a traditional JRPG involves you issuing a series of commands to party members, watching them play out sequentially, and then starting over again. As the industry moves toward *Final Fantasy XV*'s menu-light model as the standard we tend to think of this as boring, but actually it's pretty engaging when done well, because the action happens more in your head than in your fingers. *Grandia*, in particular, had a wealth of mechanics that made careful consideration of the options a joy, which I suspect is why *Child of Light* ripped it off wholesale. Ditto *Chrono Cross*, although it has not been emulated anywhere. We value this relaxed pace in other games, like *Civilization* (or chess), but have come to see anything less than "Press X to swing sword" as too slow for a JPRG. \u000a\u000a* **De facto difficulty slider**: Most JRPGs rely on a world with endlessly spawning enemies and the concept of "the Grind." A lot of players hate the Grind, and in a lot of ways that's understandable. But if you have the time and patience for it, the potential to fine-tune the difficulty to your liking is much appreciated. You can speed through dungeons and keep your battles to a minimum, which maintains a relatively low level and keeps monsters stronger than you, or you can amass huge amounts of XP and [currency] such that you way outlevel your opponents and walk around with 99 of everything in your pack, blowing through a couple hours of content in one heroic go. A single game can provide two very disparate experiences in this way. This is in contrast to games with caps on your power (like *Skyrim*, where enemies level with you, or the *Penny Arcade* games, where you only fight everything once), or games where you can explicitly set a harder difficulty, but that only really translates to more HP and longer, more sluggish battles. \u000a\u000a* **Clear structure and emotional resonance**: This is a little harder to explain, but hopefully you'll get it. Unlike a lot of games, where the gameplay stays relatively consistent, JRPGs tend to progress in phases, and each phase has an associated emotion or frame of mind. For instance, you often start out in your sleepy, placid hometown. This puts you in a home-base mode, where you explore the locations, talk with NPCs, check out shop inventory, search for items (i.e. ransack your neighbors), and start to learn the menu, all at a very relaxed pace. Then comes the first dungeon, which puts you in combat-ready mode. You excitedly head out to start testing the mechanics of battle and dungeoning, as well as to see that glorious first level up. Then comes the next town, where you're in a sort of improved home-base mode\u2014all the same activities, but with greater fluency. There's a very specific sensation of relief with each new town: oh, I get to upgrade all my gear; oh, I get to search for a new set of treasure chests; oh, that elaborately dressed woman with her own character portrait must be a new party member! Danger has been confronted and passed; now it's time to celebrate by micromanaging the crap out of things. Then comes the next dungeon, and eventually you're proceeding in this cyclical manner. You're either relieved by new towns or pumped up by new dungeons, but there's always some sort of transition ahead. This is often aided by the increasingly complex or rich design of both safe and non-safe areas: the village becomes a nation's capital; the nearby cave becomes a towering fortress. \u000a\u000a* **Empathy**: JRPGs, far more than any other genre, provide a cast of characters that you spend time with in the way you'd spend time with friends, and this is often by design. *Star Ocean*, for instance, had an entire system of "Private Actions" whereby you could seek out party members in town and talk about things unrelated to the Main Quest, like childhoods or favorite foods or (gasp!) *romance*. *Grandia* (again) had a system where you actually sit down to a dinner with your party at an inn and go around to each person exploring different casual topics (one, in the first game, involved various home remedies for constipation and was high-larious). This sort of happens in some Western RPGs, but it's uncommon enough that you can immediately point to which developers do it: Bioware, Obsidian, etc. And even these, I think, lack the whimsicality of the JRPG. There's a difference between cracking jokes with a buddy at the dinner table and doing it with a comrade on the battlefield. Though Bioware, of course, manages it better than most. \u000a\u000aThis is where I think it's most important to point out that I'm talking about JRPGs of a certain age. My main gripe with *Final Fantasy XIII* was that I had little to go on in getting emotionally attached to the characters; even if they displayed a range of emotions, it was always in the context of the Main Quest. Everyone was just too on point all the time. When I think of what JRPGs do best, I think of the scene in *Final Fantasy VII* where Cloud sees Barrett in a sailor suit and calls him "a bear wearing a marshmallow." That wackiness, even when it's kind of out of nowhere (that line is like two minutes after the first JENOVA boss fight), helps humanize the party in a way I almost never see. \u000a\u000a\u000aThere's a lot about this genre that's come to be viewed as a product of old and inferior technology, techniques and elements that only existed out of necessity. Like lining three heroes up against three slimes and having them politely take turns. But as these things get left behind in favor of more "modern" systems, their positive qualities start to come into relief. What all the new graphic-intensive, mechanically complex, breakneck-paced games can never provide, these games still do: the freedom to think and imagine as much as I want. It's no coincidence that most of these are things also found in tabletop games, which I also love; that's where JRPGs come from. But they don't require a bunch of other people to sync their schedules to mine :)

VI don't really have the money for handhelds, so I don't follow their releases that much. Also what I tend to see is either ports (*Persona 4*) or games that aren't quite of the traditional type I'm talking about (like *Etrian Odyssey*, which is famously inaccessible to newbies and also more focused on dungeons than story, or *Monster Hunter*, which is action-y and open-world). \u000a\u000aThat said, I agree with your point that the genre lends itself to handhelds more, especially since I actually happen to believe JRPGs are harmed by better graphics (though I left that out because I don't expect many to agree with it). So if you have any recommendations I'd love to hear them.

V>  \u000a\u000aI would recommend Bravely Default to you if you have access to a 3ds. It really captures the essence of the early Final Fantasy games.

sI3
VBravely Default was an absolutely fantastic half of a game.\u000a\u000aI'll admit, though, that around Chapter 7, the completionist urges to finish all of the "optional" boss mash-up battles combined with the sudden difficulty spike made me satisfied at stopping with the "false" ending.
p1037
sI4
VYou can get the good ending without beating all the boss mashups.
p1038
sI5
VOh, absolutely -- I know it's just a completionist character flaw on my part blocking me from doing that, but it just feels plain *wrong* to skip all those stars on the map and go straight to the story destinations (several times) to get to the end.\u000a\u000aWhat was surprising to me is how *hard* those encounters get towards the end. I found most of the game to be relatively easy, especially exploiting the town-building shop mechanics, but there's a sudden and huge difficulty increase on the optional battles that's pretty alarming. Even with all the best-available equipment (the locked chests were actually a little underwhelming) and maxed out classes, you suddenly have to care about strategy and composition to a pretty significant extent. Can't just spam vampire life drain repeatedly like you can for a good part of the game. Probably a good thing, but very sudden!

VLook. I'm a fighting game player. A damn good one. I have to put up with teabaggers and taunters all day. I beat almost all of them, since these types tend to be more casual oriented players.

Help?\u000a3. I've been hoarding the Enchant Armor / Enchant Weapon scrolls.  Should I continue hoarding those and save them for when I get better equipment?\u000a4. Same question on the scroll of Brand Weapon.  When should i use that?\u000a5. I also have trouble determining which of the wands / scrolls / potions I should carry on my body when adventuring.  I've been rolling with Wands:  fireball, teleportation, slowing, digging.  Scrolls:  teleportation, blinking.  Potions:  haste, curing, heal wounds, resistance, cancellation.  I have a really hard time evaluating wands, since I rarely use them.\u000a6. How do my skills look?  I just found the Executioner's Axe of Freezing, so I know if I should use it (see question #2) that I should keep training Axes until I hit 26.\u000a\u000aThanks for the help!

VJust wanted to say thanks for the advice.  Following the advice in this thread, I was able to clear out all of the Depths and the first 4 levels of the Vaults.  It's further than I've ever been!\u000a\u000aI'm now faced with the dilemma of where to acquire the 3rd rune.  Here's my latest pastebin:\u000a\u000ahttp://pastebin.com/Drc7JxBH\u000a\u000aAny advice?  I have Clarity, and a source of rCorr if I wield the Shield + a War Axe, but that lowers my damage output.  I can wear two rings of rFire to give rFire+++ and try the Scroll of Immolation strategy on Vaults.  I think that's my best option, but not sure.\u000a\u000aI've picked up everything I think I might need for V:5.  Any thoughts on what I'm carrying?  Thanks again for the help.  Very excited to have made it this far, but I've been sitting on this saved game for 3-4 days, paralyzed on what to do next.
p1081
sI2
VSeems like you are about ready for either slime, vaults, or abyss.  The clarity and rCor are perfect or slime as confusion and corrosion are the main threats, but the Royal Jelly can still be a pain.  The first time I killed him I didn't understand what the big deal was, but I have recently lost some max level chars to him.  He spawns tons of jellies as soon as you hit him and then retreats behind them.  It is easy, even with rCor to get so corroded you have no AC left at which point you are pretty much toast.\u000a\u000aVaults 5 you definitely have the gear for but it is still hard.  I would say stair dance guys up to 4 until a warden shows up and locks the stairs, at which point teleport.  I haven't tried the immolation strategy there myself but might be worth a go.\u000a\u000aAbyss is interesting; in a lot of ways it is much easier, but you can pick up a ton of bad mutations if you aren't careful.  It is also really hard to find a chance to rest so some source of regen is very helpful.\u000a\u000aJust pick one and give it your best shot.  If you die, you can easily get two runes again (I literally just lost a FoAK with two runes in depths).
p1082

VThanks for the tips!  I'm happy to say I survived Vaults:5!  In some ways it was much easier than I expected.  I stair-danced about 3 waves of the Vault Guards before I spotted a Lich.  I was able to draw him in and get him up the stairs before I ran into my first Vault Sentinel.  I had to teleport three times on the level, each time after something that summons made things a little dicey.  The Titans weren't as bad as I expected.  The Tengu Reavers were a little tougher to deal with.  I hadn't fought anything that summoned a Battlesphere before.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I'm now the proud owner of of 3 Runes!  I'm going to save for the night and read up on what to expect in Zot, but I'm feeling very confident after mowing my way through V:5.\u000a\u000aThanks again!

VDecided to make a run for it.  I've cleared Zot:4 now, one more to go.  I'm done, my nerves are shot.  :)\u000a\u000aZot:1 was the hardest.  Maybe it was the layout, but I had Cursed Toes and packs of Draconians swarming me.  I had to quaff 3 potions of haste, teleport numerous times, and make use of some very dicey berserking to pull through.  My teleports were extremely poor.\u000a\u000aI thought if Zot:1 was that hard, there was no way I could survive the lower levels.  Strangely enough, Zot:2-4 were a cakewalk!

VThat means just that players are less likely to be put into the same map several times in a row. However, the rates of all the map appearing are random and even. Just check on [Hotslogs](https://www.hotslogs.com/Default) (at the bottom of the page, Sitewide Map Statistics over the Last 7 Days section) all the matches uploaded in the last week, the numbers of each map appearing are very close one to another.

VA)\u000a\u000aSo like many others I'm on jailbroken 8.1 right now. One problem that I've had ever since jailbreaking is that after I install or delete a package and Cydia's done reloading, Cydia goes into [Loading] mode for 3 minutes (I timed it). Does anyone know the cause and if so, how I can fix this?\u000a\u000aB)\u000a\u000aIf I restore and put back a backup, are Cydia's settings restored as well? That is: package settings (Show All Changes & Ignore Upgrades). While I'm at it: where can I find these Cydia settings so I can manually back it up? (I know it's not the preferences plist located in User/Library/Preferences.) Is it the User/Cydia/metadata.cb0 file?\u000a\u000aC)\u000a\u000aThe battery problem. Even in Safe Mode, it slurped away 1% per minute, sometimes when I was loading something over 3G I even lost 5% in a (couple of) minute(s). I've read a bug in locationd in jailbroken iOS is the cause? Disabling location services didn't really help, Airplane Mode however did. Note that I was still in Safe Mode while the drain occurred. Do we have to wait for Pangu or Saurik to fix this?\u000a\u000aD)\u000a\u000aCydia's AutoInstall folder is broken. Has the location \u2013 where we should create it in \u2013 been changed or something similar? Or do we have to wait for Saurik to fix it?\u000a\u000aE)\u000a\u000aAnother problem I have is being stuck in safe mode. Due to being too lazy to install almost 250 packages one by one, have Cydia lag 3 minutes every time and then respring or reboot\u2026 I've put back everything at once with PkgBackup and started deleting uncompatibles while also ticking the 'Show all changes' setting so at least I get a heads up when updates arrive. Result: still in Safe Mode, not all packages I installed are in [the](https://docs.zoho.com/sheet/published.do?rid=z1v909ff833ece6824400b4d4095ac3a277ac) [three](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/wiki/ios8) [lists](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2014/10/23/list-of-jailbreak-tweaks-compatible-with-ios-8/) I checked. Note: don't trust these lists to be completely correct. **Tl;dr:** Could anyone be bothered to point out packages you've found to be incompatible with iOS 8? Or otherwise help out? :)\u000a\u000aI've made a little progress after deleting 58 packages. It doesn't directly go to Safe Mode anymore: my Winterboard's springlogo shows first, then it enters Safe Mode.\u000a\u000aI'll post my packages list in the comments.\u000a\u000aThanks a bunch!\u000a\u000a^^If ^^you ^^read ^^all ^^of ^^this ^^I ^^love ^^you ^^nevertheless

VOk, let me preface this by saying I am a software developer myself, I know a large majority of suggestions I see on Reddit simply aren't within the development lifecycle of Destiny I, maybe 2. They aren't going to rewrite the way destiny works (eg transmorphing armor) just because people complain. \u000a\u000aThey are in a sustainment phase, so here is something I believe would be fairly easy to implement, which would also improve play-ability and replay ability. \u000a\u000aMy idea, is to create an exotic vendor like a Vanguard or Crucible vendor, with a large variety of exotic weapons and armor, which changes on the weekly cycle. So every piece of exotic equipment is available at least once a month. \u000a\u000aNow here is the kicker, which I believe makes this reasonable. Make the exotic items EXPENSIVE eg. 100 SC, 15000 glimmer, and 10 vanguard commendations to purchase a Gjallahorn. Expensive but not unobtainable.\u000a\u000aA high price for highly sought after exotics, lower prices for more common less sought after exotics. \u000a\u000aThis would allow those Day 1 players who never got a Gjally from a drop and missed it the first time an opportunity to get it. While also allowing other players, myself included, to strive towards purchasing something special, not just hoping against hope that one day Xur will have what I want (at which time I buy one for each guardian) Or I win the Exotic lottery and get one from a drop.\u000a\u000aIt would also alleviate the pressure for players who might not be able to catch Xur in the short time he is there. \u000a\u000aThoughts?\u000a\u000aTL;DR - Add an exotic vendor with rotating stock selling exotic armor and weapons with expensive pricing. 
p1135
sI1
VI don't know about you but I have probably 30+ exotics...they aren't very exotic in that regard. \u000a\u000aIf I had to budget my SC's and Commendations I would have to carefully consider what I wanted to purchase. \u000a\u000aI for one wouldn't be able to just buy them all right way.

VStory:\u000a\u000aBuddy had sexual relations of a girl who was underage (17), and he's in his mid-20s. He took pictures of her nude. Not that it matters, but he had consent and they were never intended to be distributed.\u000a\u000aHe's now facing charges of Production of Child Pornography. The case is federal because he has transferred the computer across state lines (to himself, no distribution).\u000a\u000aThe federal mandatory minimum sentence is 15 years.\u000a\u000aIs there any chance that the charge can be lowered if he takes a plea deal? The mandatory minimum seems extremely harsh (5 years *longer* than if he tried to sell a 17-year-old in a sex trafficking operation).\u000a\u000aIs there anything that can be done here, or is he guaranteed for 15?
p1150
sI1
VI'm assuming it was a lot of pictures. He was with her over a substantial amount of time (Admittedly I don't know the full details though).\u000a\u000aWhat would constitute the crime going federal? From what I read:\u000a\u000a> Federal jurisdiction is implicated if the child pornography offense occurred in interstate or foreign commerce.  This includes, for example, using the U.S. Mails or common carriers to transport child pornography across state or international borders.  Additionally, federal jurisdiction almost always applies when the Internet is used to commit a child pornography violation. Even if the child pornography image itself did not traveled across state or international borders, federal law may be implicated if the materials, such as the computer used to download the image or the CD Rom used to store the image, originated or previously traveled in interstate or foreign commerce.
p1151
sI2
V> What would constitute the crime going federal?\u000a\u000aYou said he transported it across state lines, right?  That gives the feds jurisdiction.\u000a\u000aHowever, the feds don't have to take jurisdiction just because they can.  What /u/DaSilence is saying is that the feds don't take chump cases; so if your friend drew fed attention, it's not a single picture. \u000a
p1152

VGot it. Was wondering if that was the sole purpose of it going federal. I assumed it was because of the state lines thing, but was wondering if it could have happened because of a large volume of pictures.\u000a\u000aAlso, does the number of pictures count? As in, if there were hundreds of pictures of 1 girl, is that substantially worse than a handful if they were never distributed? I assume multiple girls is automatically a red flag.

V*[Map-in-progress pending administration conversations! Assume you don't directly have a new neighbor as result of this post. I'm off in the middle of nowhere...just trying to find an applicable 'nowhere'.]*\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000a**Origins**:\u000a\u000aSolos experienced great death and decay during the week of the Titans. Other nations were splintered and battered. But this time of tumultuous chaos and disarray was also the birthing means of Vord. A wounded Titan would wash up on the Southern gulf of the island one stormy night, toward the beginning of the week, bleeding profusely and jittering uncontrollably. Despite its evident wounds, it still posed a significant threat to the inhabitants of the island. \u000a\u000aWith great effort, and only due to the wounds the Titan had already endured, the people of the island were able to defeat the creature, slaying it and protecting their homeland. Two things happened, then. For one thing, the people of the island had found themselves working together for the first time ever to defeat a common foe.  They had been but outcasts from former empires and from themselves, interacting with each other as sparsely as possible. In light of their tremendous victory, they decided that their power and potential for survival was greater as one nation than many splinter factions. And so the island nation of Vord came together over a rather short span of time.\u000a\u000aThe second thing that had happened was the decay of the Titan! Even in death, the creature proved a marvel. Its blood would not stop bleeding, its bones would not stop growing. The citizens of Vord drank of the blood of the Titan and grew stronger than ordinary humans could imagine. The citizens of Vord fashioned out armaments, utilities, and structures from the ever-replenishing resource of the Titan\u2019s bones. They built a mausoleum like a citadel around their resource, protecting the fallen Titan from outsider interaction. \u000a\u000aOver the span of a week, Vord went from creation to a small superpower. But there was only so much Vord\u2019s citizens could do, for there were only so many of them. Across the entire island nation, there were less than four hundred thousand lives. Most were warriors or criminals, exiled from their former nations or lost at sea. Only a few had any sense of organizational background, and so chomped at the bit to set up a governmental infrastructure. They called themselves the Gafeld, and immediately took advantage of the physical and human resources available to them to begin formal expansion and development of the island. This is an ongoing process.\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000a**Miscellany**:\u000a\u000a* Gafeld has not yet had much contact with other nations, save for the fact that they themselves originated from various landmasses, settlements, and principalities. For this reason, they do not have much in the way of imports or exports and instead rely on self-sufficiency. In that regard, resources taken from the body of the deceased Titan are generally of the highest value.\u000a\u000a* At this time, Gafeld is primarily interested in the settlement and development of its own island. Its outlook of the rest of the world is unclear, though they are not opposed to mercantile interaction.\u000a\u000a* The military of Gafeld is by far the largest subset of the population. There are approximately 370K citizens of Vord, and of those Gafeld\u2019s military is around 220K strong. All have been armed and equipped with bones of the Titan, and fueled by the blood of the Titan, growing into heightened killing machines. Having said that, the military is cautious of aggression and advancement. They do not know the limitations of their strengths and they do not wish to find out the hard way.\u000a\u000a* Religion is starting to creep up in Gafeldian society. It primarily centers around the reverence of the Titans. Though they have slain a Titan out of self-defense, the death of that Titan was the birth of their nation. Understandably so, Titans are very highly regarded throughout Vord.

V* Modifier by era. For example, have 1/5 the base warmonger changes that there are now, but multiply that outcome by the era. In the Industrial Era, warmonger penalties would be about what they are now. In ancient, they'd be very small (allowing some warfare again, since warmongery is also based on total number of cities it's very hard early game), but by the information age, invading another country would make you automatically a villain.\u000a\u000a* Decline over time. This could be done one of two ways: Either remove some warmonger penalty each time you enter a new era, or recalculate every time a city is settled. Both have their advantages - the latter is more analog and allows for early aggression in later starting games or one era games, the former solidifies roles each civ plays in each era and helps counterbalance unique units.\u000a\u000a* All city states count as one empire. If there are 22 city states, taking one should be no more of a big deal than taking a single city off of a 22 city empire. Some empires like Mongolia or the Huns rely on being able to be aggressive towards city states. Once there are fewer left, though, they become an endangered species, and people care more and more about their loss.

VI'm originally from Norway and moved to the states about 9 years ago. I currently live in Texas, far from my ideal world. I absolutely hate it here. I have no plans on staying here. The problem is my boyfriend, who is from Florida, do not want to leave the country, never mind move somewhere cold. \u000a\u000a\u000aI have been upfront about my desire to leave Texas. I offered a compromise of living in Seattle since the city seems like it would match my hometown culture and scenery. Unfortunately, he will never do that either. He complains about the cold, the rain, and finds other negatives as well. I just can't wrap my head around it.\u000a\u000a\u000aMy boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years and I am set on hopefully marrying him one day. He's the best person in my life, but that doesn't mean I want to live my life for him. If I stay in Texas, I can guarantee I'll lose a little part of myself every year... I already feel like that's happening, and I don't want to prolong it! \u000a\u000a\u000aI told my boyfriend I would have no problem waiting till he was finished with his masters and I was finished with my nursing degree (about 3-4 years) so he could get work experience and I could easily get a transferable job. He doesn't like that either.\u000a\u000a\u000aOne of the problems I have with staying in the states are my family properties in Europe. I don't want to sell them, and one of them is a huge family heirloom basically. There is no way I can take care of two expensive properties while living a world away. When I try to bring this up, my boyfriend laughs at me and refer to them as the one percent problems... I'm not rich... I can't afford those plane tickets or the upkeep from America.\u000a\u000a\u000aI have tried to talk him regarding this, but he shoots it down and says not to worry about it yet... well I'm worried! If he doesn't see a future with me in 4 years time, why even stay in America for school? What if he just goes back on it in 4 years and refuse? By that time, I've already wasted so much of my time, effort, and worry on someone who refuses to compromise on any ground. I'm not saying he has to move to Norway... I'm saying it could be Seattle, Maine, Boston, London UK, Nice France, or Norway. Hell I'm open to options, just not where we are now. \u000a\u000a\u000aHe's not a big traveller and still hadn't managed to save enough money to visit my home, what if he never does? My biggest fear is that I get stuck with someone I love who will want me to sacrifice everything I want in life for him...\u000a\u000a\u000aTldr: my boyfriend (25) of 3 years won't compromise on our future together.

VI understand that a column still has the potential to strip the mash of all its flavor, but can't distillers just run it at a lower temperature?\u000a\u000aI also understand that there are hybrid stills combining a pot still with a column still.  Is this just for efficiency, or is there a flavor difference?
p1269
sI1
VWell, bourbon can't be distilled above 80% anyway, so you can be fairly sure that those distilleries using column stills are probably not running them at peak efficiency (in terms of the ABV of the output, anyway).  The biggest efficiency gains from a column still come from the fact that it is continuous, not batch, like a pot still.
p1270
sI2
VColumns don't have to be continuous. I'd say most smaller distilleries that use columns run batches.\u000a\u000aYou're really only looking at the big grain whisky (and vodka) distilleries that are continuous - Cameronbridge, North British, Absolut, etc.
p1271
sI3
VA column still is inherently continuous.  You pump in the wash in from the top, and the steam from the bottom.  Distillate comes out the top, waste out the bottom.  This process is continuous, in that it performs the distillation as the wash is pumped in.  This is distinct from a pot still, where you fill it up with a charge, seal it, run it until it is done, then stop, empty, clean and repeat.  You may have a "batch" in a column still, in that the wash isn't flowing into the still 24x7, but it is still a continuous operation while it is running.  \u000a\u000aAt least that is my understanding of the process.
p1272
sI4
VNot all column stills are continuous.  Normal column stills use cooling at the top of the column to knock the vapors back down to the plates instead of using new wash.  Continuous stills are generally only used by low/med grade producers as the product is deemed inferior.  
p1273
sI5
VYes, they are.  A column still == a continuous still.  That is the whole point of a column still.  There is such a thing as a hybrid still, or a pot still with a reflux column.  Is that what you are talking about?  If they don't inject the wash at the top, where does it come in?  Into a pot at the base, right?  That makes it a type of pot still or hybrid, not a column still.  Again, I don't distill for a living, but I have yet to see a reference to a non-continuous column still outside of the home setups that are technically a pot still with a reflux column, not a true column still.\u000a\u000aContinuous (read: column) stills are in use at Buffalo Trace, Heaven Hill and Beam, just to name a few.  Do they make inferior product?

VI'm about planning to do a play-through of Skyrim on Master difficulty. I'm planning on having Skyrim Redone, ASIS _and_ DUEL installed. I want the overhaul to everything except the enemy AI module installed from SkyRe, I want the increased spawns and NPC Perks modules from ASIS and the Combat module from DUEL.\u000a\u000aJust wondering if all I have to do to make it work is install SkyRe with Enemy AI disabled, then install ASIS with only spawn+perks modules, followed by a full DUEL installation? I have used them together before, but forgot about one module overwriting the other, and just wondering if this will work out perfectly fine? :) Thanks!
p1285
sI1
VI'm using the perks in SkyRe. (What ASIS does is simply let enemies also use perks, but I want the SkyRe overhaul of perks) And I'm also going to use the Enemy Scaling plugin of SkyRe, because I like the way it scales the enemies the best, and neither ASIS nor DUEL has an enemy scaling function as far as I know.
p1286
sI2
VSkyrim Unleashed has a really cool enemy scaling system. I use it alongside SkyRe, and DUEL for combat.\u000a\u000aI just wish there was some way to bypass SkyRe and SkyrimUnleashed's economy changes. The prices are fucked, like $27 for a carrot, $1600 for Iron Armour while the sell price is $60. It's retarded.
p1287
sI3
VI don't mind the prices, actually. I run Economics of Skyrim next to it, along with other economical-based mods, and the increased prices / lowered sell-prices (not as low as yours by far, more like $1600 BUY / $200 SELL) are rather balanced the way I see it.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I've tried Skyrim Unleashed, but I actually prefer the SkyRE scaling along with encounter zones. Only thing that sucks is that Bleak Falls Barrow is scaled for players that are at least level 10, most likely because of ASIS giving additional perks to enemies. Playing on Expert or Master - a single arrow to the knee one-shots you at level 3. :(
p1288
sI4
VWhat bothers me is the immersion factor. A room and a double-bed for the night? $10. Quest dialog. Untouched. A carrot? A potato?? $27. \u000a\u000aThe economics of Skyrim have to be balanced at every angle; just like SkyRe can't properly fix the perks without overhauling spells and potions too, you can't just make things more expensive without rebalancing loot level lists, vendors, and quest dialog. \u000a\u000aThere needs to be like, a reproccer for prices. 
p1289
sI5
VWell, Economics of Skyrim does that for you. Using that in addition to SkyRe makes everything seem perfect for me. I do agree that it should be balanced somehow, considering potatoes are 3 times as expensive as a room (unless you overhaul room prices, which I have too!).\u000a\u000aBut yeah, as I said I do agree with you on the economical point of Skyrim Redone, it's rather terrible. But even if it is terrible, it is better than Vanilla. At least that's my opinion. Skyrim Redone is a gameplay overhaul, so the fact that it does not touch the Quest Dialog is fine by me.

VIncase of TL;DR : I fell for fuck buddy, he fell for me but wont date me due to me being raped when we dated previously, 3 years ago. I want my fuck buddy to trust me that I was raped and need some advice.\u000aPlease read the whole story if it's not tl;dr.\u000a\u000a\u000aOkay, so as of right now, I have been seeing my fuck buddy for about 3 months. We've known each other for nearly 4 years and I've had a crush on him ever since. I really really like him, he really really likes me too but he won't date me ever. Again.. The whole back story :\u000a\u000a\u000aI went to this anime convention where I met my first boyfriend, and the guy who took my virginity. We met at the pool, where my fuck buddy ((I'll call him J)), was playing trance music/raving music by the poolside. I was silent the whole time with two guys who were his friends, ((one being my now ex boyfriend whom will be G)), swimming in front of me, back and fourth. J played one of my (at the time) favorite songs, and I glanced up at him and told him it was a really good song, and that he had good taste in music. He smiled and nodded at me while his friends hovered me. They started talking to me about Daft Punk and then we got on the subject of video games. Well, we got more into detailed talks and ended up hanging out over that weekend. J was never really around me because he was extremely shy, he couldn't even talk to me. Well, I started texting with G, because he gave me his number that Friday night, and we talked for a long time. We started dating about a month later, he took me on a date and everything and things were okay. The first time we broke up, he called me fat and ugly, so I told him if he thought that then he doesn't need me. I was, at this time, sneaking out of my mom's house to stay weekends with him 2 hours away. The night we broke up, I was laying on the couch in the living room ((I was 15 at the time because I was retarded as fuck, so I had no car to get home)), and J walked into the kitchen to see me there and invited me to stay in his room. He wouldn't allow me to sleep on the floor, and I told him I didn't want him to sleep on the floor so we agreed for us to sleep in the bed together, which was very nerve rattling for me, being I had a crush on him. I can only imagine how much his nerves were rattled compared to mine. Well, we just cuddled and that Sunday night, he took me home. A few weekends later, I was sitting at the park, 1am, waiting for J to pick me up ((he invited me to stay the night with him.)) When he got there, he asked me to be his girlfriend and of course I said yes. That weekend went great, he took me home that Sunday night and the next weekend came up, he picked me up again. This was the bad weekend that I will never fucking forget. G was acting so upset and depressed, and I'm a very nurturing person, I treat everyone like I'm their mother when they are upset so I talk to them and make them feel secure until they feel good enough to stop talking. Well, I went to talk to G and he pulled off a lot of guilt tripping stories of how he was thinking of killing himself and how he can't live without me, so we sat outside and I tried to talk him out of it. Well, when I thought he was okay and we went inside, he pulled me into his room and threw me on the bed. I've had a history of terrible sexual abuse, and in these situations, I freeze up and cry, I get too scared to move. He got on top of me and started choking me and I started trying to push him off. ((He was 22 and I was 15, I'm not very strong when it comes to pushing people.)) He started threatening me with killing me if I didn't do what he wanted. He then began to pull my clothes off, then proceeded to choke me. He completely forced himself inside of me, while I'm kicking and trying to get him off. I finally gave up, I was scared of him and couldn't hardly breathe, he nearly made me pass out. Before that night, he had never been that way, he was never abusive or mean or forceful. It was absolutely terrifying for me. J ended up seeing some of it, and getting infuriated at me and G. When G was done, all I could do was cry, I couldn't hardly move from the pain of being forced. J stopped talking to me, I didn't know what to do. He thinks I cheated on him, that I wanted to fuck G but I really really didn't want to be around G after that night. \u000aThe sad part was, after J cut ties with me, I got so depressed that I started thinking "G will be the only one to ever want to be around me now, so there is no point in trying to date anyone else" I basically got sired to him. I had trouble with dating, hence why he was my first. I really didn't want to be with him but I felt like I needed to. I ended up getting married to G, we were dating only a year when we got married and it was forced upon me by my parents AND him. I was scared to leave him, and he wouldn't leave me, so my parents made me marry him if we wouldn't leave each other. He "cheated" on me in February of 2014, which made my mind switch to start hating him, which I was fucking glad. I eventually left him in July of 2014, and started staying with my old friend. J started texting me again and we just talked a little, on and off until about March of this year. We started talking more and more, and he decided that we would come hang out with me. He started visiting on weekends, and he treated me like a girlfriend. He would treat me so sweetly, and he acted like I was his girl, minus the "I love you" part. I have got to the point to talking to him about how I feel about him, he tells me "Well, it's not like I don't like you like that, I just can't ever date you." I would ask him why and he would just say, "because of what happened with you and G." I keep explaining to him that I didn't want it, that I hate him because of that night and all the abuse through the relationship. He tells me he doesn't trust me, which I understand why, but I didn't do anything wrong other than be overly nice to someone I expected to respect my relationship. If I knew that it was going to happen, I would have never talked to him about anything after I broke up with him. I was naive and stupid as fuck back then, I don't know what to fucking do and it's driving me crazy. I really like J, he really likes me... How can I get him to understand my point of view and trust me enough to date me again?\u000a\u000aIf you have any advice, please help me out, I'm in need. I'm going to be seeing him tomorrow night and spending the whole weekend with him for A-kon. Please help if possible.

VHe actually doesn't use me for sex, he actually spends time with me, takes me out still, and legitimately treats me like a girlfriend. He doesn't think it was rape because he saw barely any of what happened, he just glanced at my ex on top of me, naked, and that was all he saw. I can honestly understand why someone wouldn't believe that because some people do fake like that, just to use an excuse to cover up their mistakes. 
p1309

VSo he doesnt believe you when you tell him it was rape? He just doenst trust you in general? Still not seeing why you would want to be with someone like that?\u000a\u000aThen if everything is fine, what are you complaining about?

VI don't know if he believes me or not, He doesn't trust me. I'm basically asking for advice about getting someone's trust back, even if I'm a trustworthy person to begin with.
p1311
sI4
VWell no, if hes saying he doesnt trust you then he *doesnt* believe you. Otherwise what else is he saying "I cant trust you not to be raped again?"\u000a\u000aYou cant regain peoples trust. You either trust someone or you dont. And he clearly doesnt trust you, if he doesnt even believe what you are saying - afteall he doesnt trust you to tell him the truth.\u000a\u000aIt really isnt a healthy relationship by all sounds to be honest. Imagine the arguments where he throws it back in your face.
p1312
sI5
VI'm really naive and all, but I feel like trust can be regained. It takes time, but if I can get him to realize that I was raped, then maybe he will actually understand. I'm the only person he has ever dated, I took his virginity. \u000a\u000aBack in April, we had a huge accident, and our condom broke. We went the next morning and got the morning after pill and I took it. It didn't work, and I began having nausea all the time. I took pregnancy tests, and the first one popped up positive so I gave him a first warning and told him I was going to the doctor. I was positive by doctor from blood and urine tests. Even before I became pregnant, he was treating me like his girlfriend. He would cuddle me, take me out places, take care of me when I stayed the weekend with him, and he wouldn't even ask for sex, it just happened. We would spend all day cuddling and spending time together, like we were a couple, if sex happened it happened. The same thing for after I got pregnant, he has been sticking around with me before the pregnancy and even after conception. He hasn't changed how he acts at all around me. He actually randomly texts me and tells me he misses me, and that he's excited to see me. We, even before pregnancy, would see eachother every weekend. We still see eachother every weekend. I honestly think that if we talk more and more about the problem, that he will come around, but I would love to hear from someone's PoV, which I don't mind people telling me it won't happen, but I just want to have hope. He doesn't treat me like shit, he doesn't abuse me, and he wants to actually be around me without sex. I think he could possibly get over it.

VHey all. This is a question that has been plaguing me since I watched the trailer. What are your thoughts? 
p1324
sI1
VExactly, I'd feel the same. I was in London when Mass Effect 3 came out, and there was a HUGE campaign for it there - huge billboards, stuff everywhere. And yet, no FemShep; only BroShep. I went into a shop that sold a lot of nerdy collectibles and looked at their huge Mass Effect display, and there was NOTHING with FemShep on it. \u000a\u000aSo often, if there's an option, the male is seen as default which furthers that societal problem of seeing male as default and female as the other. 
p1325
sI2
VThat's a big issue with mass effect, I didn't even know you could BE a girl when I first picked up 2. 
p1326
sI3
VWell that's the thing; every time someone trots out that figure of the percentage of people who play BroShep vs FemShep, a lot of people act like "oh women don't play games" or "oh people want to play as a male character, when people might assume that BroShep is the only Shep before playing, or just choose what they assume is the default before starting the game. 
p1327
sI4
VWhich is a shame. Femshep had the better voice actor
p1328
sI5
VIt was the same thing for Halo Reach. I mean, my character was *always* the female version, so I wasn't really familiar enough with the male version to compare. But everyone I heard from on the matter insisted the female voice was far better than the male. I think it was the same voice actress as FemShep, actually (I don't play ME, so I'm not absolutely positive).

VObvious spoilers on map and/or puzzles. Don't read if you haven't explored/solved the [Shipwreck](/spoiler):\u000a\u000a...\u000a\u000aSo, like I'm sure all of you, when I first found the Shipwreck Puzzle I was ill-prepared for it. I did realize it was an invisible mirror, but as I stared at it for a while the first time around I had to turn down my speakers as that annoying ship noise wouldn't stop. That's fine. I left and would come back later.\u000a\u000aI did later come back. Finally having realized the sounds I previously muted were actually important, but I still couldn't figure out how.\u000a\u000aI searched the environment for clues for a long time. I tried to find the location of the dripping water - maybe that had a clue. Then I gave up and started trying to just interpret the drips. \u000a\u000aOne thing was obvious to me: There were 3 colors on the panel, and there were 3 drips in a row. Clearly that was related! So I used Audacity to cut up the drips into just hearing the first, then second, then the long third (Obviously the long drip was the third, right?)\u000a\u000aSo in the end, I finally faced the truth that I was not able to do this, and I looked up the answer. Well, turns out I had the drip order wrong, I had the color correlation wrong, and I wasn't even listening to the other sound. Who expected I'd have to record minutes of audio just to get any pattern?\u000a\u000aStupid cheap obscure puzzle that beat me! I hate you!

VIt's difficult but it's not ambiguous at all. \u000a\u000aA) Every puzzle with two starting points should be tested to see if there's an invisible mirror line. All you have to do is go to the center and see if the invisible line blocks you.\u000a\u000aB) The line color = dot color rule was established with the mirror line puzzles. The color rooms taught you what a teal dot in red light should look like. \u000a\u000aC) The pitch = dot size rule was established in the jungle. You can hear seven sounds ( three drips, four "groans"). \u000a\u000aThe only logical leap you have to make to solve this puzzle is that drips correspond with one line and the "groans" match the other. 
p1349
sI2
VI think you've misunderstood my point. Sure, the puzzle itself had clearly defined rules, but I found the sound was unnecessarily muddy and the sets of sounds were poorly delineated, making 90% of the challenge trying to listen to loops over and over to even know what the data points were (see custron's comment below) Sitting there with everything figured out, listening to long annoying groans for the 80th time was not my idea of fun
p1350
sI3
VCompletely agree. The groan sounds were so irregular and such a slur of notes that I immediately discounted them as distractor noise, and even when I tried to listen to them I couldn't discern a clear 3 notes to correspond to the puzzle dots. I spent hours editing clips of the drips together and was especially put off by the fact there's actually 4 or 5 notes in the dripping, which I was meant to interpret as 3? Even though I was supposed to also listen to the unreasonably spaced groans? It's the only puzzle I looked up and when I got the solution I didn't even feel bad. The sound design was flawed and imperfectly matched the pattern on the panel, unlike literally every other puzzle in the game. 
p1351
sI4
VThe groans are not actually irregularly spaced..... They are evenly spaced. There is also a LONG pause after the last groan before it repeats.
p1352
sI5
VI didn't mean irregularly spaced (I should have been clearer), I meant the notes themselves were irregular, in that they weren't single notes, their lengths, pitches and rhythms (within each groan) were irregular. As opposed to every other sound we had to listen to in the game which was a crisp, clear, single note.

Paying the fine is pleading guilty.\u000a

Basically anything that happens with a vehicle will show up on the MVR.
p1358

VMaybe MVR's are *explainable*, but they sure aren't debatable.  The whole point is that the show the true driving history.  It's a lot more likely that the accident showed up on your CLUE report as an at fault accident, but if it showed up on the MVR as at fault vs. the CLUE, I imagine that they'd take weigh the CLUE heavier than the MVR.

VI hope this is not lost in translation. \u000a\u000a\u000aSome years ago I was working the graveyard shift in my office, so in the afternoon / night I was the only one dealing with tickets and phone support. Normally we only do basics tasks, like setting up internet, install projectors, reseting accounts, etc. However, by the nature of our office, any problem related to anything working with electricity can become our responsibility. And we have many bosses, so we try to do our best in the most cases.\u000a\u000a\u000aOn a day like any other I received a phone call from an user with an unusual problem. He said that the day before he was working without problems, but when he was checking out, the backpack of his laptop no longer opened, which was a a greater nuisance for him. He was wondering if I could go to the office to check his backpack and see if I could open it. Basically he was telling me I was Thor and the backpack was Mjolnir. It could only be opened by someone that was worthy.\u000a\u000a\u000aI was thinking I had many reasons on my behalf to just say no, I mean, the backpack is not an inherent problem to tech support right? However, the user in question was a middle boss, I never had problems with him, his office was not far away and I did not have much work, so my curiosity was stronger and confirmed him that in five minutes I would be in his office.\u000a\u000a\u000aI gathered all the tools I could thinks because I had no idea what to expect. Some screwdrivers, a saw, a hammer, some tweezers and an UTP cable (you know, habits).\u000a\u000a\u000aArriving at the office I lead to the user's desktop, which greets me somewhat puzzled to see all my tools. Again he explained me the problem. He added "I'm sorry to interrupt you, never had this kind of problems", and proceeded to tell me how he had already tried everything in the known universe to fix it, without examples, but backpack would not open. On his desk were resting the laptop and the backpack on the floor, obviously closed. \u000a\u000a\u000aHe says: "Can you please open it?"\u000a\u000a\u000aOf course, I can try for sure. I was unpacking one of my tweezers when a voice inside my head advised me ask something first, so I say: "Can you please repeat the last thing you did so I can try to duplicate the problem?" To which the user says yes, proceeded to sit on his desktop, open the laptop, wakes it up, and tries to open Firefox, which for some reason does not open.\u000a\u000a\u000a"See? The backpack doesn't open" - He said. And was until that very moment when everything clicked. Backpack in Spanish it's called **Mochila**, and as you can see it's very similar to **Mozilla**. And it was true, his laptop could not open Mozilla Firefox. Making an big effort to not laugh, I sat down, opened the task manager, I closed all the Firefox programs and I did 2 recommendations: \u000a\u000a1. Turn off the laptop instead of putting it to sleep, to avoid that programs like Firefox freeze.\u000a2. Stop calling it Mochila Firefox. Call it Firefox only.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe second recommendation was a surprise to him. "There's a difference?" he asked. To which I replied that there were other older Mochila browsers like Netscape, which could be confusing.\u000a\u000a\u000aThen I excused myself with pretext of going to install a network node, just in case they ask about all the tool.\u000a\u000aTLDR.- ¿Donde está la biblioteca?

I havent had a dream in years that I can remember ( I know we all dream, supposedly ).

For those that say I should look for p-values and what not- p values need you to have something expected first (chi-squared method: ( |expected-observed|-.05)2 /e ). They have to be able to see how far off the data collected is from what I expected, and currently I have no expectations of what I will find. If that is overtly wrong, please correct me, and comment how to correctly find a p value off of a histogram. Thank you.

VSo I finally played Watch Dogs after hotly anticipating it forever (haven't finished the story yet, so no spoilers please). People are wrong when they say it's a terrible disappointment, but I felt there were just a few simple things that would have made it a lot better that if used in a sequel would make it perfect. I was hoping Reddit could weigh in:\u000a\u000a*A higher difficulty curve. One of the things I was disappointed by was how powerful you are right from the start. It takes a fraction of a second to hack something, which made it feel a little unsatisfying. I expected that you would start with only one weak profiler ability like signal jamming and work your way up. And you do upgrade, but how powerful you are at the beginning takes away the urge to work toward upgrades. Far Cry 3 is a great example of how a Watch Dogs sequel could handle this better; you start with virtually nothing, which makes upgrading much more enticing.\u000a\u000a*The random criminal encounters shouldn't be so finicky. Possibly my biggest frustration with the game was how easy it is to accidentally tip off the criminals and stop something that could have been fun. This led me to wasting time tailing a criminal with no payoff. In a sequel, it would be more satisfying if the crime basically is going to happen whether you're there or not. The window of time where you can swoop in and save the day should be much bigger too. Many times I felt like the crime was easily in progress by the time I intervened, only to accidentally abort it because I was half a second early. It's odd that the guards can be so ignorant when you're knocking over a control center, yet the random criminals seem to have perfect eyesight and superhuman peripheral vision. The problems with this feature make it feel not so much unsatisfying as broken.\u000a\u000aThese are the major ones that stood out to me. What would you like to see? Improved driving? A better story?
p1452
sI1
VYou're right about the karma bar; it really makes no sense. It's just an attempt to add realism that backfires because it makes the unrealistic parts stand out more. Like the fact that people seem mystified as to whom "the vigilante" is, despite the fact that there's usually dozens of witnesses to your actions and you wear the same clothes all the time. I know you're a blur on the cameras or whatever, but nobody followed him or anything? He's not exactly inconspicuous. I guarantee in real life people would figure out who he is in like two seconds. Also, why is everyone's grammar and spelling so good in their text messages?\u000a\u000aHand to hand combat would be fun if implemented correctly. The takedowns were okay, but something more involving than basically just running up and hitting the button would be appreciated. And the clothing options were so limited they might as well just not have had them.\u000a\u000aBut maybe the real reason I'm talking about a sequel is because I'm bitter about how little it lived up to the hype, and what I was imagining in my head. I thought it would be "the next step in video gaming." But it wasn't, really. It was good, but ultimately felt like they took the good ideas from five different games and put them together into one game that's less fun than any of them.  Strategically clearing out a gang hideout or CTOS building is exactly like knocking over the pirate fortresses in Far Cry 3, but less fun. The parkour is just like Assassin's Creed, but more limiting since there's not enough things to climb on. The crime themes are like Grand Theft Auto, but not as well written. The digital trips are like Saints Row diversions, but aren't as exciting and feel out of place. The "random, unscripted fun" sandbox attempt had potential but ultimately there's very little to do, and the somewhat flat story isn't interesting enough to keep me motivated. In the end, they make me want to just play those similar games instead.\u000a\u000aThe game feels like a rough draft. It has a lot to build on, there's just not quite enough substance to any of it. But a sequel that fixes the stupid parts and adds more fun things to do could be the game that Watch Dogs was SUPPOSED to be. Assassin's Creed 2 was more like an "Assassin's Creed 1 only better" than a sequel, and Watch Dogs feels like a LOT like Assassin's Creed. We'll see.
p1453
sI2
VI actually made the same comparison to assassins creed. It felt like AC1. Sweet idea, fun gameplay, decent story, but it all could be heavily improved upon. With the success of Watch Dogs I could see the same happening here. \u000a\u000aI really do hope they improve the story and writing though it was pretty atrocious and eventually made me stop caring about the story missions, which were the most fun ones. \u000a\u000aMy only worry is that Ubisoft is too busy working on DLC they love to push on us instead of making the game better. If they'd used the delays to their advantage we'd have a game everyone would want dlc for.
p1454
sI3
VEvery single problem with the game could have been redeemed if the story had been good. Seriously.\u000a\u000aAfter the e3 trailer, I had all kinds of speculations about what the game would be about. I thought maybe Aiden would be some kind of former CtOS employee and vocal advocate for the system--A clean-cut, nerdy programmer who was always smiling, happy, and well-liked by his co-workers. But when his superiors tried to rub him out for knowing too much, he became a cold, ruthless criminal who would stop at nothing to destroy the system he once loved.\u000a\u000aBut no, turns out Aiden is just a boring action hero from the start.

VSame on steam. 91 here, catching up. I got the PS4 in November, so I've been on that hard and ignoring PC in the meantime.

I rent all the time though, Just finished Dying Light (LOVED it), and Farcry 4 before that. Gamefly is amazing.\u000a\u000aI'll have to get back to you with my PSN name, but we should collab around releases/whenever one of us gets a game with decent co-op/multiplayer, PSN or steam. Right now I'm winging it, but looking forward to Borderlands re-release with full couch or internet co-op. I think..March 24th?\u000a\u000aLastly, I can tell you are disappointed you didn't get a woman. Luckily, I'm newly single, and would love to talk about/work together meeting some women. It makes it soooo much easier and less awkward. I'm only about 2 years deep but my game is decent enough. I tried to do this with a friend though by going on tinder and out to bars, he just stole my ex's number and tried to bang her...lol.

I work at a Library so i can rent those games out way before others can get them haha. \u000a\u000aHow is GTA5 on PS4? i heard it's amazing and the FPS part of the game actually was fun. \u000a\u000aThis meeting women thing is a good plan my game for bars is kinda lacking...

VAwesome, I felt bad somehow.\u000a\u000aHoly similar situation! My last gf cheated in one month by kissing, I'm like mehhh. 2 months later she madeout with best friend and was in bed with 3 dudes when I found her again. Luckily, my  friends warned beforehand of red flags I missed and had my back after. So, sorry that happened to you :/ One of my friends just lost most of his friends and his two cats over a bad breakup.\u000a\u000aI mean, dying light has it's strengths and weaknesses. I really liked it though after that 3 hours of suck in the beginning. I absolutely loved the story, and melee (best damage models ever). Everything else is cool, only things I didn't like was $20k weapons breaking permanent after around 2 days of use, and how slow zombies moved.\u000a\u000aGTAV on PS4 was definitely awesome. It's a totally, totally different game. I cut it short because I just played on 360 before that.\u000a\u000aBars can be rough. It's all about body language. How you stand, dress, walk through the bar, take that pool shot, and most important how you look at them when you catch the eyes. The talking part is hardest. It's easy to open, but around the middle you are out of things to say..So..you..wh..how bout that local sports team? I find it best to ask her questions about herself and just be chill/smooth the whole time. They will talk your ears off. Then near the peak of her excitement you ask for the number and go back to friends.

I'd say "look at garage sales," but really, you are better off getting new, at least as far as non-stick goes. \u000a\u000aIf you are feeling really daring, you can go the cast-iron route, as those pans are much cheaper. But, they require seasoning (pre-greasing them and baking them in the  oven) and are tricky to learn to use. There is a whole subreddit for that, though, r/castiron , check that out if you are so inclined.

While not having a gamepad sucks and their crazy expensive (average $150 on eBay) I wouldn't mind buying this if I could just get a pro controller and still be able to do everything minus playing without the tv. Is this possible?  I can borrow a gamepad for any initial set up stuff so that's not a worry. I just don't want to put the money down and then be unable to game on it at all. I've heard mixed things about this so I'm hoping you guys can help me out.  Thanks!

VCool and thanks for the quick response. I'm still debating it heavily and I'm gonna try to talk him down. I figure for the price he wants + the price of eventually getting a gamepad, I can probably find a better deal 
p1581
sI2
VYeah I agree with what you are saying. \u000a\u000aTechnically it's possible, financially I think it would be a stupid purchase.\u000a\u000aBetter saving for the full set.\u000a\u000aAlthough Im not in a great position to lecture about finances. I buy way too much Nintendo stuff.\u000a\u000aI bought 2 wii u's on release, worst decision of my life.

VHonestly I've held off because (and no offense to you guys who bought early) I didn't feel it was worth it at a $300 price point considering I have a 3ds so I can already get the great nintendo experiences. And it being so underpowered really pushed me away. I love Mario and all the nintendo games but just couldn't justify it.

VObviously, the biggest news today was flipping Cap'n Jack for RJ. The Warriors fanbase is divided on whether this was a good move, since RJ's contract lasts a bit longer (through 2013 with PO through 14 which he will undoubtedly exercise).\u000a\u000aThat last bit is what worries most fans, even though we got draft picks for this upcoming hyped-up draft class. My question is: Can we amnesty Jefferson's contract NEXT YEAR or is there a rule saying we can't amnesty traded players?\u000a\u000aIn addition, if we did amnesty RJ next year and no one picks him up, does that mean he is just a FA?\u000a\u000aTL;DR: Does Stephen Jackson looks like James Brown to anyone else?

VYou're allowed to amnesty one player over the life of this collective bargaining agreement, which, I believe, is 10 years. Using the amnesty on Charlie Bell was a pretty short-sighted move, in my opinion.

VWe all know that Shepard is unique somehow. It is stated throughout the third game by many (including the Leviathan and the Starchild). Because of that he is able to finally break the cycle provided he doesn't refuse, of course.\u000a\u000aBut why is Shepard able to stop the Reapers once and for all? One theory, putting all the pieces together, is the following:\u000a\u000aIt is stated by the Prothean VI Vendetta that time is cyclical... not just because of the Reapers. Some things necessarily happen, like a group that wants to control the Reapers rather than destroy them. Before our cycle, the Reapers came through the Citadel to the world and killed many before they could react. \u000a\u000aNow let's assume that there has been a Shepard equivalent in all cycles before, like there has been a Cerberus equivalent. All these previous Shepards got killed fighting the Reapers early and because the whole galaxy was under attack, nobody could do anything about it. The previous Shepards stayed dead and did not succeed in breaking the cycle.\u000a\u000aThen the Protheans came and because of Ilos, they were able to delay the Reapers in our cycle. "Our" Shepard got killed as well (ME2 Prologue), but because the Reapers were not here, people had time to react. As we all know, this resulted in Shepard being rebuilt by Miranda and Cerberus in the Lazarus Project. That means, that even though our Shepard died as all the previous did, he was resurrected and therefore able to finally break the cycle.\u000a\u000a**TL;DR: The Protheans delayed the return of the Reapers. The Shepard of our cycle thus didn't stay dead and was able to break the cycle.**\u000a\u000aWhat do you think? Valid theory or nonsense?

p1632

VThis. Learn HTML, CSS, then JS before you start touching templates or frameworks.\u000a\u000aIn a professional environment, you will probably use templates and frameworks in order to spend more time on developing functionality, but that does not diminish the importance of having a strong foundation.

VI disagree. In high school I tried to learn programming by picking up a well regarded book on it. It tried to start with all of the core competencies, the syntax, the jargon, the what's and the whys.\u000a\u000aIt confused me and I gave up certain that I just didn't have it in me.\u000a\u000aYears later in college I was studying graphic design and my clients needed websites. Learning to copy and paste working code meant I could get shit done. I didn't care how it worked just that it worked, at the time I was still very convinced I couldn't possibly be a programmer.\u000a\u000aEventually I could tweak the code as I needed to. After a year of copypasta magic and stack overflow worship I realized I actually understood a lot more than I thought I would ever be able to. I decided to learn more about how the code worked. \u000a\u000a4 years out and I'm extremely comfortable with not just Javascript but Python, Ruby, and the related competencies, data modeling, algorithm design, databases, et cetera. Stuff I never thought math troubled me would ever be able to do.\u000a\u000aStarting with the easy things can mean you see the results of your work far sooner and in far more interesting ways.\u000a\u000aOn the other side though, since I started with AngularJS and AJAX is so tightly wound with it I seriously didn't know how submitting an HTML form worked until 3 years into my professional career. \u000a\u000aI acknowledge there are a lot of things I've missed, gaps in my knowledge and that sucks sometimes. If I hadn't felt productive hacking away I never would have learned to love programming.

VAhh, a camcorder!

All my friends were working at grocery stores.\u000a\u000aAnyways, I'm on the phones one day when an elderly lady calls in with a computer problem and I give her my standard speech, "Thanks for calling Yada Yada, my name's [name], how can I help you."\u000a\u000aShe informs me that her computer is 'being slow'.\u000a\u000aI tell her that she'll need to bring it in, that there's not much troubleshooting I can do over the phone.  (This was pretty much my mandated go-to line for non-Internet related support.  We didn't make money unless they brought the PC in.)\u000a\u000aI proceed to start asking her a few questions so she has less paperwork to fill out when she brings it in.\u000a\u000a"Alright, ma'am, what operating system do you have on your computer?"\u000a\u000a*silence*\u000a\u000a"Windows XP?

p1684

VI don't think strict liability applies to domesticated animals, like dogs. It's for wild animals.  Like if you own a tiger.
p1685
sI2
V"If you own an animal with a known disposition you do so at your peril. Will be held strictly liable for inures inflicted on third parties." *Sandy v. Bushy*\u000a
p1686
sI3
VThe key is *with a known disposition*.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Restatement (2d) of Torts, Sec. 518:\u000a\u000a> Except for animal trespass, one who possesses or harbors a domestic animal that he does not know or have reason to know to be abnormally dangerous, is subject to liability for harm done by the animal if, but only if,\u000a\u000a>(a) he intentionally causes the animal to do the harm, or\u000a\u000a>(b) he is negligent in failing to prevent the harm.\u000a\u000aSo this affirms my earlier comment.  Strict liability ordinarily does not apply to domesticated animals, unless the owners knows or has reason to know that the animal is "abnormally dangerous."
p1687
sI4
VAnd actually the reverse is true. Wild animals are strict liability except not really because if the wild animal is known to be harmless then SL doesn't apply. \u000a\u000aIn reality it's all just negligence because if having the animal is dangerous then you've negligently introduced it into a situation. Domestic with violent disposition or wild with violent disposition, the exceptions remove Strict Liability even though it continues to be taught that way.

VI'd make sure to know the song inside and out, that way nothing can trip you up. One thing that will really light up their ears is if you can do chord/melody versions of each of them (playing the chord voicings and melody at the same time). Also being able to take a really short 8 to 16 bar solo on each of them in time (without a backing track) that follows the general melodic theory of the song (switching modes between chords, etc) will really impress them.

The designated driver took me home, and I took a nap.  My mother woke me up and asked me to go to the store to get her a pack of cigarettes and I agreed. I ended up going to the bank first, getting cash and then on the way to the store I was pulled over for swerving.\u000a\u000aThe first officer who came out took my information, and then two more showed up. they asked me to step out of my vehicle and I complied.  They told me they smelled alcohol on my breathe. I let them know I had been drinking earlier that evening.  they then asked me to do a field sobriety test.  \u000a\u000aThe second office started the test to conduct it, using the pen method.  I wear corrective lenses and I told them that it was extremely hard to see due to my eyesight.  (I wear glasses)  He did the pen test and seemed quite unsure, so he got the third officer to conduct the test.  \u000a\u000aThe next test that was given was to walk heel to toe.  I let them know that I have a back and neck injury from a deployment in Iraq. (I have the paperwork to prove this as well). The third test he had me do was to hold my foot 6 inches from the ground, I cannot do this at any time due to my injuries.  \u000a\u000aI was then detained and they brought me in for a breath test.  The officer asked me my height and weight, and during some small talk told me that his pet peeve was DUI's.  The first time he had me breathe into the machine he said it wasn't good enough and that I had to blow harder.\u000a\u000aThe second time I blew into it, the reading came out at a .12 BAC.\u000a\u000aThis would be my Second DUI, the first one I was arrested in 2006. (underage and a .11 BAC) Is there any way I can legitimately fight this?  I am seeking legal consultation at this time but I would definitely like some help from a non partial party as well.  \u000a\u000aThe Charges are DUI, Careless Driving, and failure to provide proof of insurance (The insurance card is in my vehicle, but is stuck in between some other paperwork.)

p1775
sI3
V> You blew a .12. On what grounds are you going to fight it?\u000a\u000aThat's what you said. That's what I was responding to. Fact is breath machines are wrong all the time, they are not always properly maintained, they can be easily gamed by the officer to read higher (as appears may be the case here), and they are easily influenced by physiological conditions completely unrelated to intoxication. I read the other facts, I think they are more of a problem than the test and I said that. I am just pointing out that a breath test is not the end all of proving intoxication, and we shouldn't treat it as such. There are many ways to challenge a DUI even when there is a breathtest over the per se limit. \u000a\u000a\u000a
p1776

VMaybe if the OP had not admitted to drinking. That admission pretty much throws any body chemistry challenges to the validity of the breath test especially if combined with a blood test. (which the OP did not say either way if they drew) 
p1777
sI5
VIt is extremely rare for them to do both a blood and breath test *at least in my jurisdiction and in my experience. I think because they have much more control over the evidence with a breath test and because they most likely will not be the same so it will impair the credibility of both tests\u000a\u000aAn admission is not direct evidence of impairment. I think it is one of the more persuasive facts for juries, but the challenge to a chemical test is rarely  "I wasn't drinking," it is "I wasn't impaired" so it is not linked as you would believe

VWhat are the mechanisms with which vestigial organs can evolve?  I understand that if a mutation increases probability of reproduction it will be passed to more and more generations.  But if a mutation renders an organ useless, but is neutral to reproduction, how did that mutation get passed down to the point where it is in every current member of the species?

VThanks for the example.  Is it correct to assume that those born with shorter legs had an environmental advantage:  a streamlined body contour for swimming and hunting for food?  If so, I do understand how legs would slowly disappear, due to those whales with shorter legs having a survival advantage. Same question for an appendix, if a human or primate were born with a non functioning appendix,  why would that trait propagate the species?  I guess I'm following the whale example but not understanding the mechanism that would propagate a non functioning appendix... Unless a functioning appendix were somehow detrimental like hind legs in the whale scenario.  Thanks for your thoughts!
p1797
sI2
V> Same question for an appendix, if a human or primate were born with a non functioning appendix, why would that trait propagate the species?\u000a\u000aYou might try shifting your point of view here. It's not that a non-functional organ would be beneficial, so much as a non-functional organ is *not detrimental*. If an organism is fully capable of surviving long enough to reproduce, and has some organ that isn't working but isn't causing a problem either, then the faulty organ might be passed on to offspring.\u000a\u000aAnother factor here is that there are always trade-offs. Organs are expensive in that they require energy to grow and maintain. If an organism can get by without using as much energy to support that organ, then the organism might have more energy for other things. So it could be the case in some scenarios that a functioning organ that isn't useful is more of a liability.
p1798
sI3
Vanks.  maybe my premise is incorrect.  I'm assuming that the human species evolved before the appendix became effectively non-functional.  If this were the case then the thought experiment would be say 10,000 humans existed, one has a mutation for a non-functioning appendix.  it does not cause harm, so it is passed down from there down that branch of human evolution.  But the other 9,999 humans continue to reproduce with a functioning appendix.  So my question there would be why do all human's today have a non-functioning appendix?  But maybe the premise is wrong.  I'm guessing the right answer is that a set of our non-human ancestors had this mutation (and so the mutation was there in some but not others), and the branch that eventually evolved to become human had the mutation, so all humans have it.  Is a fair understanding?  Thanks!\u000a\u000a\u000a

V> If this were the case then the thought experiment would be say 10,000 humans existed, one has a mutation for a non-functioning appendix.  it does not cause harm, so it is passed down from there down that branch of human evolution.  But the other 9,999 humans continue to reproduce with a functioning appendix.  So my question there would be why do all human's today have a non-functioning appendix?\u000a\u000aThe term you're looking for is called [genetic drift.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift) It basically means that a neutral trait can increase or decrease in frequency in a population by random chance.\u000a\u000aThere's also the [founder effect.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect)\u000a\u000aHumans went through several bottleneck events in the past. This means that our population crashed and then rebounded from a small number of individuals. Some of these crashes took us down to 10-15,000 humans. When this happens, it causes ratios of genetic traits in the population to swing wildly

In the final 4.5 hours, the T1 cutoff increased by 5094 while T2 increased by 4251. Furthermore, this is the first time that the point gain in the final half hour of a token event has breached 1k.

Wire is still attached and they still work just won't stay on my head. But I want to get a 7.1 surround headset. I have a 5.1 sound card with intentions of upgrading.

VYeah, that was why it was changed. If you look [at the CL regulations](http://en.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Regulations/competitions/Regulations/01/48/42/49/1484249_DOWNLOAD.pdf) you find this:\u000a>The UEFA Champions League titleholder is guaranteed a place in the group stage even if it does not qualify for the competition through its domestic championship.\u000a\u000aThis is the general rule. Then you find subsections a and b, which would apply to the Premier League:\u000a\u000a>a) If the titleholder comes from an association entitled to four places in the UEFA Champions League and qualifies for the UEFA Europa League \u000athrough its domestic competitions, the lowest-ranked club of the \u000aassociation\u2019s UEFA Champions League representatives is automatically 2 \u000atransferred to the UEFA Europa League  (into the latest possible round \u000awhere there is a vacancy). In this case, the number of places to which the titleholder's national association is entitled in the UEFA Champions \u000aLeague and the UEFA Europa League does not change.\u000a\u000a>b) If the titleholder comes from an association entitled to four places in the UEFA Champions League and does not qualify for the UEFA Champions League or UEFA Europa League through its domestic competitions, the lowest-ranked club of the association\u2019s UEFA Champions League representatives is automatically transferred to the UEFA Europa League (into the latest possible round where there is a vacancy). In this case, the national association of the titleholder is entitled to one additional place in the UEFA Europa League.\u000a\u000aSo in no way can there be an additional spot in the Champions League granted. If Spurs/Chelsea were to win CL and finish the season in 5th (scenario A), then they would get the CL spot, and the 4th place team would get the Europa League spot along with Birmingham and Stoke/Bolton. If Spurs/Chelsea win CL and finish 6th or worse, then they would get the 4th CL spot, and BOTH the 4th and 5th place teams join Europa League, along with Birmingham and Bolton/Stoke.\u000a\u000aThere is no scenario where we can qualify for Europe without finishing 5th.

However I have a huge insecurity that is starting to become an issue. \u000a\u000aBasically I used to self harm pretty badly from the ages of 14 - 18 due to being depressed / issues at school and it has left me with some pretty bad scars up and down both arms. (around 50 scars in total) They are extremely obvious and I am deeply ashamed of them. I got the help I needed (intense therapy) and am no longer depressed and have also been clean for almost 2 years now with absolutely no desire to self harm ever again, but I have no idea how to show him my arms without scaring him off.\u000a\u000a It is summer where I am and wearing long sleeves around him and refusing to be too intimate during the day in fear of him seeing my arms is really getting tiring.

VHey there, I just discovered this sub so this is my first post. I recently purchased my first 1911 from an active police officer. Its a Colt Defender. It is in pretty good shape with a few blemishes here and there but nothing major. I assume the gun as seen some range time since the previous owner used it as his side arm. I have a guy who wants to trade me his Kimber Pro Carry II for my Defender. His seems to be pretty much brand new. I'd like to hear some opinions as to whether or not I should make the trade. Neither gun will be an everyday carry so I'm not concerned with the difference in barrel length. I'm more curious if going from a Colt to a Kimber would be a bad move? Thanks for any advice.\u000a\u000aEdit: Here is my Colt: http://imgur.com/6KQIvzY  Here is his Kimber: http://imgur.com/L0PdiD7

VThanks for the input! I sort of share the same sentiment as you. Just wanted another opinion on it. I guess my real reason for asking is because I know the other guy's Kimber is almost mint and mine has quite a bit or range time. I don't know much about the longevity of these guns. Just assumed maybe newer would be better??? Also, here are pictures of both guns. Mine: http://imgur.com/6KQIvzY And his: http://imgur.com/L0PdiD7

VYou won't regret keeping it. As far as longevity goes, it is almost indefinite. You will wear out parts like springs, mags, and maybe even the grips.

VI remember being young when NAFTA was being put together and - at the time - was under the impression that it was supposed to create a market free-for-all for all of North America. Obviously, this isn't the case. So what is its benefit for the countries that are a part of it?
p1920
sI1
VShouldn't the removal of these tariffs also level the cost of some items across borders? I know that things wouldn't be the exact same price, but  it seems like Canadians often pay up to 33% more for a lot of things. It feels as if that type of thing should have been lessened too.
p1921
sI2
VYes, but differences in what Canadians pay compared to Americans is impacted more by the foreign exchange market, not trade tariffs and regulations. You will see some stabilization of prices, because free markets tend to do that.

VI'm not sure what a lot of stuff means yet so if I don't make sense I apologize. I had just rooted my device. I just went into the regular recovery using the volume up home and power button. When in recovery I first did a full backup by basically just clicking backup. Then I wiped data/factory reset and then cleared cache partition. When i tried to install cm10 it failed and when i re booted my phone it went back to the original s3 setup where it asks things like your language etc. And I had no previous ROM installed, just stock 4.1.1 on a SGH-T999\u000a

VCurrently swallowing the pill and the way I spend my time has undergone a change. For example, I cut out most video game time (unless it just the guys playing some N64 Mario Kart whole hanging out) and stopped watching TV and Netflix save for a select few favorite shows when there is a new episode. I unsubscribed from subs that just wasted my time and have cut back on Internet and social media time.\u000a\u000a I read a lot more now, including TRP-oriented literature as well as novels for pleasure. I also spend more time fishing because it is more interesting and rewarding than other things. And to top it off two weeks ago I bought an acoustic guitar and I'm trying to get back into learning it. \u000a\u000aI know everyone is different and you can't necessarily single out certain hobbies as not TRP. But I do find these activities more rewarding and was wondering if yall have any insight or similar experiences? 
p1990
sI1
VDefinitely with all things you have to have your priorities and think about long term first. I still find time for my interests and hobbies outside of that.  \u000a\u000aBut on gaming: Yes it can be fun and rewarding where skill is required but I feel it could sometimes give me a false sense of accomplishment and was one of the first things I cut out while swallowing the red pill. I'd recommend others do the same during their swallowing.

VI'm very new and just started swallowing the red pill yesterday, but I've been considering cutting out video games for a while. Your post helped me decide. Thank you
p1992

VGlad I could provide some insight. There's plenty of opportunity to stay within your interests too though. Especially in reading. I'm a huge Lord of the Rings fan and wanted to try the new game, but instead I just picked up the books that I hadn't read since 8th grade. If you like Halo read some science fiction. If you like COD or Battlefield pick up No Easy Day or a war novel.\u000a\u000aSince you're early in on swallowing it, always keep the TRP sidebar material handy to read.

p1999

VIn that case the Paladin, Bard, Warlock or Sorcerer could do the conversation ;)\u000a\u000aBut Perception helps when someone is sneaking up on me, Insight helps when someone is lying to me. All of those are actions you do not pick the player to do the check.\u000a\u000aMost of the time you're better off dumping Intellect or Charisma than Wisdom, that is why people suggest you dump those.
p2000
sI3
VEvery time I've seen insight checks used, the person asks if they can use it. Perception, yes, is good for everyone but if the group is staying together and the people with decent perception are at the front and back of the group it isn't the end of the world to not have it. Don't get me wrong, I agree that charisma and int are, in general, better stats to dump than Wisdom if they aren't necessary for your class abilities, but there can definitely be pretty bad downsides to failing charisma and int ability checks too.
p2001
sI4
VThat is true, there can be downsides and I never meant to deny that.\u000a\u000aIt's just that the downsides to a low Intelligence/Charisma are much much lower than on Wisdom.\u000a\u000aDon't forget that being surprised is on an individual basis ;) it just means that you did not see it coming and need 6 additional seconds to react.

VThat leads to an intresting question: Who exactly decides what playtime is fair for 60$?\u000a\u000aIt's people selling you the game (insert any bigger publisher here) that try to establish short times as ok. This is an effort to push critique away as entitlement. Like labeling concerned customers as trolls, this is a similar process of demonizing. \u000a\u000aIt already works. Look at all these people that go with the argument "I have work/other time consuming activity, but I want to finish the game so it should short".

V> That leads to an intresting question: Who exactly decides what playtime is fair for 60$?\u000a\u000aIt's entirely up to any individual consumer.  To some buyers a 5 hour game that was fun throughout could be well worth $60, for others they might demand much more.  Entitlement seems a valid description for customers who blindly buy a game and expect more than what was promised.  If an individual thinks they deserve more than X hours of gameplay that's fine, but that decision needs to be made *before* buying a product, not after.  If X hours isn't enough for what the game costs, then don't buy it.

VBiggest problem is that you cannot check how many hours you get out of it easily. \u000a\u000aReviews are spiked enought with publisher-money to give you crap numbers, veteran games will be faster to play through, replayability is hard to measure or a game can contain stretched parts to artifically lengthen the game.\u000a\u000aThe only way of preventing this is to wait for some time until the game has established a reputation. Sadly, you get cut off a bit for doing so by cut out content that is given to pre-orders.

VI have just started reading into this whole culture and am really excited about making my first purchase. I thought I'd do as much research as possible prior to buying my first quality headphones. I've taken a look at many different guides and discussions, but there is a characteristic I'm looking for yet haven't seen discussed - or at least maybe it has but I didn't understand the terminology used.\u000a\u000aI am a musician and often times like to listen to songs to pick out parts. I've noticed that depending on the different speakers or headphones used, individual instruments sometimes stand out alone and are easier to really hear exactly what's going on, and at other times isolating the tune played is very difficult. For example, my macbook speakers are the worst for learning how to play the bass guitar. \u000a\u000aSo onto my question, is there any resources that look at this isolation of instrument quality I'm looking for? Or are there any headphones that are known for this quality? Thanks!\u000a\u000aEdit: I just want to clarify I'm not looking for purchasing advice. More about resources or discussion regarding the quality I'm looking for. Whether it is something that is discussed at all or something people consider when looking at headphones.
p2036
sI1
VThanks! I wasn't sure if soundstage was what I was looking for since all the descriptions I've read refer mainly to sounding like you are in a concert hall rather than studio or club. I haven't seen any discussion on instrument separation, but I will search that keyword if it is the correct terminology to use. \u000a\u000aI'm looking forward to checking out some headphones in person. I'm in Toronto and have found a shop that seems to demo higher end headphones. It is the next stop once I've spent some more time reading about the things to look for when making a purchase.
p2037
sI2
VIt really depends on what type of music you're listening to.\u000a\u000aYou're talking about instruments isolation so I assume you're not listening much to electronic music or hip-hop/dance.\u000a\u000aIn that case, you want headphones that have a pretty neutral signature. Depending on your budget, you're looking at something like Sennheiser's 558 / 598 / 800 or AKG Q701 / K712.\u000a\u000aThese are all open headphones with pretty huge soundstage and very neutral.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, if you want something with a little more bass, you're looking at entirely different headphones like Sennheiser Momentums, Beyerdynamic DT880 / 990.\u000a\u000aAnd if you want absolutely no bass and bright mids/highs, you can try any Grado headphones.\u000a\u000aAnyways, go into the shop you found and try different ones with a song you're very familiar with. You will be able to figure what I'm talking about and find your preference.\u000a\u000aWelcome to the community!
p2038
sI3
VThanks for the advice. I'm mostly listening to jazz, funk, and classical. I'm under the impression bass heavy headphones are not the best for clarity, but just bass impact? To clarify, those types of headphones will make you feel the bass more, but not necessarily be very articulate and clean in sound? I love instruments in the bass to cello range, but clarity is more important for me than to sound "boomy". \u000a\u000aSorry for maybe the weird terminology I use for describing sounds. I honestly have no idea how better to describe these things. Hopefully with some time and experience I'll be able to get these things down :)
p2039
sI4
VWell there's cheap bass that will indeed make your headphones "boomy" but the bass will also hide everything else and make the mids/highs sound muddy.\u000a\u000aYou have headphones like the Beyerdynamic DT880 and DT990 that are shaped in a "V", meaning they have good bass, pretty neutral mids and bright highs. Depending on your preference, you might like these better than everything neutral.\u000a\u000aWithout having tried a lot of headphones with different signatures, it's hard to find what you really prefer.\u000a\u000aI also listen to jazz and my personal preference has been with very neutral headphones like the Sennheiser's I listed above.\u000a\u000aGood luck finding a pair that you'll like and don't forget to report back with pictures and your experience :)
p2040
sI5
VI will for sure report back :) I plan to head out this weekend to test some out. I will definitely try the Sennheiser ones. Hopefully I can discuss instrument separation with the staff and get them to show me a few of the headphones that may be best to try along with the ones recommended. \u000a\u000aDo DAC and AMP have a big impact on soundstage and instrument separation or is it mostly a headphone quality?

VThis is LONG, really long, and took a while to type.\u000a\u000aI will start this story with 24 year old me, I applied for a job in a local petrol station and got it, it was my first full time job since the economy fell on its backside.\u000a\u000aI used the job to get through night courses in plumbing and bricklaying, all a waste of time by the way since nobody would hire at a rate that could have paid rent for an apprentice, so i went on to learn how to drive with the extra leftover after bills, also a bit of a waste of time, since jobs were like gold dust.\u000a\u000aI settled down into the work after a while and got used to the workload, it consisted mostly of serving customers, stocking up and generally overseeing the smooth operation of the petrol station over the night, we had to watch out for drive off's etc etc.\u000a\u000aWhen the oil derrick exploded things at work started to deteriorate slowly, I was lucky because I had a 40 hour contract and I was the only full time worker on nights, my shifts were safe but the micromanaging started very slowly trickling in, new schemes started, online courses popped up (these were multiple choice questions, with a 100% correct rate needed to pass or you start over, with 40-50 questions, I shit you not, our assistant manager knew these answers off by heart thankfully)\u000a\u000aMy shift, me and my co worker started suffering on nights, area managers would come in during the day and randomly check on us through the cameras, questioning things we did, our break times, this was all up to us and we always got the work done and the shop ready but they didn't care, we would always be told we did something wrong or missed something, it got tiring.\u000a\u000aThis went on for a couple of months, then they got a new area manager in and he decided that the night shift had too many people working on it, the guys who worked with me were shifted onto another time period and I was left alone on the nights, to serve at the pay window, we had 12 pumps and a big shop, I had to constantly run around and get things for customers, which involved me walking around the side of a large till area to the front of the shop each time and also watching the forecourt.\u000a\u000aI found myself a bit stressed, the first reason is I could not take a break or sit down to eat, I ate where I worked, going out the back to break was not allowed and if I did people would be pounding on the window, yelling and beeping car horns, I also found that the same would occur if I needed the toilet, angry people would greet me at the window after peeing or defecating, they didn't care and were mostly rude, apparently it doesn't matter that I process food and water, they just want their petrol.\u000a\u000aThis went on for about 6 months, I had nobody to talk to at work, had no time to eat properly, frequently had stomach ache from getting up to get someone a pack of chewing gum in the middle of the night while I ate.\u000a\u000aSalvation came when the site was sold to [REDACTED], they reinstated the two people on night, they had more workers during the day to handle all the customers and the stock, nights became a bit easier to put up with but that didn't last sadly.\u000a\u000aThe company that brought into the shop area complained they were not making enough money, they cut the day staff and this put more pressure on the nights to do more work, we handled it between the two of us but then we were lumped with an absolute nightmare of a manager and our good manager kicked out.\u000a\u000aThis new manager was a bastard, he would come in at 1am and micromanage us for 5 hours or so, he got told off for this when we went to human resources and instead he would come in half hour before we ended shift and tell us we need to do a bunch of things before we left, we never stayed to do them even though he offered to pay overtime, which he wouldn't because the company would crucify him for it.\u000a\u000aThis guy was eventually ousted after he called up our old manager and started shouting at him (he would do this after getting drunk), the manager recorded this happening once and sent the recording to head office, that was the end of that idiot, he had given us hell for about 7-8 months and everyone was glad to see the back of him.\u000a\u000aThings were ok for a few months after that, if you compare it to having a drunken maniac shouting at you over the phone some nights and yelling at you in the morning, but then the company sold off the site to a private owner.\u000a\u000aThis owner was the worst person I have ever met, his first action was to cut the night shifts to one person, me again, alone on the nights, 5 nights a week, angry customers at the window whenever I went to the toilet, to make things worse all the stock changed and they got mad about the old stock not being there.\u000a\u000aThe tills were not compatible, at all, the card machines broke down, this was a problem because I only had one till to work with, try explaining to someone they have to go somewhere else, get cash out and come back while leaving the car on the forecourt, it usually ends with them pissing off and not coming back (pumps are activated at the till, if you have three people pumping and the card machine has an error when they put the card in you are fucked).\u000a\u000aThe new manager started doing shady things, he called a staff meeting one day and told us all that we are responsible for drive off's and he will take it out of our wages (he was the franchise owner and paid our wages), this resulted in a lot of arguing and people walking out, I stayed because I rarely had drive off's and I feared not being able to pay rent was worse than losing £40 here and there.\u000a\u000aI started having a mental breakdown, I would talk to myself at night because of the isolation and the stress eating, I started getting angry at the customers who got angry with me and the complaints started rolling in.\u000a\u000aWhen a business transfers ownership the contract for the current staff is protected for 6 months, after that it falls to the new owner what to do with the staff, they can simply decide not to renew it after that, this is exactly what was about to happen to me at the end of the 6 month period, my friend who worked across the road had the same manager, he always knew what was going on and his manager was my manager, both franchise sites for the same man, he told me one day that after my contract comes up it won't be renewed, I could count on his word because he was never wrong about these things and had never lied to me (to my knowledge)\u000a\u000aI had a months warning and I decided enough was enough, I arranged to move out, cancelled all my bills and services, let the landlord now I was moving in a month and arranged to move back with parents, I also arranged to move on the day I got paid, I decided to fuck him over by being on the road to another city instead of turning up for work, he also lived in another city and would have to come in when I didn't, suck on that, bitch.\u000a\u000aI feel a lot better now I am back with parents again, I can try and learn a trade now, might be doing it a bit late as I am 30 but better late than never, I have lost half a stone since moving and feel a lot healthier, the stress has gone and I am generally a lot happier, I have enough savings to support myself and my mother here for a long time,or until I find decent work.\u000a\u000aThere is no possible way I can TL:DR this, its long and its my shortened version of the last 6 years of my life and how it was awful.\u000a

Vwell thats just an opinion, my personal opinion is it was a lot more fun working my way up the levels,if its too easy you'll miss out on half the game, if you wanna lose interest get to WM+ and stagnate for a month when even the RTG cards dont even improve your EX deck, i don't remember losing interest in the game at any point before fusions or login bonus was around and i'm sure there are plenty of people who would agree with me on that, did you ever lose interest?\u000a\u000ai'm also not actually complaining about it, just think it shrinks the longevity of the game for newcomers, everyone seems to be getting herded into the top tiers so quickly that everyone will end up on the same level without much changing at that end, then you'll have even more ppl complaining about no new tiers or cards

VHey r/dogtraining I'm dealing with a pretty bad issue with my 2yo 55lb Pit/Lab mix Casey and wondering if any of you has experienced the same problem.\u000a\u000aA little background: When I adopted the dog (at about 1yo) I noticed he was playful and rowdy with other dogs, but very cautious and worried around people. He was very shy, but sweet with my girlfriend and I so I decided to adopt him. During the first 6-7mo I had him I tried to socialize him as much as possible by taking him to dog parks, friends BBQs, etc. He was also pretty easy to train commands like sit, down, stay, etc and tends to listen to me well. He was always shy and cautious around strangers, but it was never a problem until recently.\u000a\u000aNow whenever we have strangers over to the house it's recently escalated to snapping, growling, barking, and nipping. This seems to happen mostly with movement (stranger walks forward, reaches/leans for something, or moves an object). Most recently, there was an incident where he nipped a guest fairly hard a drew a spot of blood. Needless to say after that, and the new behavior he's exhibiting, I don't allow him around strangers anymore unless he's on a leash and it's scary/embarrassing when we have people over to the house. He's also very unpredictable in that he's totally fine with some people (and generally ok with most strangers outside of his environment). He can go from wagging his tail to snapping within a split second. I think much of this could be related to him not being properly socialized with people during his first year as a puppy, or perhaps he's trying to protect us from strangers he deems as threats?\u000a\u000aI'm having a professional trainer come over in a couple weeks to address the situation and in the meantime keeping him separated from strangers for safety concerns. I'm just wondering if any of you have experienced this - I've been reading a lot of stuff online, but everyone seems to have a different technique and this is a pretty complex behavioral issue that's a bit over my head.\u000a\u000aTL;DR Casey is displaying what I think is fear/territorial aggression towards strangers. Problem is escalating to the point where he can't be around new people. Not sure how to proceed with fixing the issue.
p2066
sI1
VHey KillerDog, thanks so much for this advice! I'll be reading, watching, and working on all these things the next couple weeks with Casey.\u000a\u000aHere is some info on the trainer I'm getting: http://lotp.weebly.com/mark-dunlap.html he's supposed to be good and deals with behavioral issues on a regular basis. I chose him mainly because I saw a couple great reviews online from people having similar fear aggression issues with their dog. If he can help me get this issue under control it'll be worth every penny. There are a couple of IAABC trainers near me as well I may contact if the problem gets worse.
p2067
sI2
VI would stay far, far away from that trainer. The website is full of red flags; most notably, a bunch of his dogs are wearing prong collars and he believes in alpha theory nonsense. \u000a\u000aI would bet you my paycheck that his answer to your pup's fear aggression is going to be to crank, spank, and yank your dog into "a balanced state". \u000a\u000aI would really, really recommend you don't chance this dude screwing your dog up even worse, and go with the behaviorists from the get-go. With IAABC behaviorists, at least you *know* they're qualified.

VSo yes, I got the job I had interviewed for, however as the title suggests, the manager also mentioned that several of my references she contacted were critical of me. She said that she was "on the fence" about me because of this, however there were also references that couldn't say enough good things about me and this is what tipped her in favor of hiring me.\u000a\u000aMy question now is what I should do about this. I asked her which references in particular and for some details(its pretty informal) but she didn't want to tell me. I'm glad I got the job, but this concerns me and I wonder how to weed out these bad references while still keeping my resume in tact.\u000a\u000aI have listed on my resume one job in particular where I left without giving notice. The work environment was toxic, and I had always assumed that I would be able to clarify if asked directly. The only reason I kept it on there is because I didn't want any gaps in my employment history and didn't think it would be that damaging. Should I keep this on my resume? Is there another way to handle it?\u000a\u000aAlso, I don't know about any other of my sources that were critical of me. I know for some of the ones that would have only nice things to say about me, but is there a good way to figure this out? Should I call my sources and pretend to be an employer asking about myself? I was always under the impression that my resume was a pretty strong one.\u000a\u000aEdit: I'd like to know not only who is saying what about me, but also what was said. I think after I've had this job for a bit, and they feel like I'm a good fit, I will bring it up again, as I am pretty sure former employers aren't supposed to go in-depth about you. I only had two references listed, so I am not altogether sure if one of them just said something that came off wrong while trying to appear to give a balanced opinion of me or what.\u000a\u000aThis bothers me for the normal reasons of course, but it also bothers me because I am going into a new job with the impression that I am already on thin ice.

Look at the Corsair h100i for an idea of what I mean :)  and yes the z170 hero is an amazing board. If it's a little too expensive, the ranger is a good alternative as well and slightly cheaper.

Vi linked what you sayd to my friend and he sayd that it is without the other cooler that it fits then... ?? dh15 has two fans. so do i need to unequip the second one from it?? or should i get a different cooler? anyways what i read about that Corsair h100i it isnt as good in tests as those noctua air ones.\u000a

VDear r/bapc, \u000a\u000aThis is not my first build, but I'm at a loss here. First, the goods:\u000a\u000aMotherboard: ASUS M5A97 AM3+  \u000a\u000aCPU: AMD FX-4100 Zambezi 3.6GHz  \u000a\u000aGPU: XFX Radeon HD 6790 1GB  \u000a\u000aPSU: Antec NEO ECO 520C 520W Continuous Power ATX12V  \u000a\u000aRAM: Kingston HyperX Blu 2 x 2GB DDR3  \u000a\u000aHDD: HITACHI HDS721050CLA362 (0F10381) 500GB 7200 RPM  \u000a\u000a\u000aThe system boots normally and the idle temperatures are nice and cool. However, **heavy stress reliably induces a hard lock or BSOD**. I've provoked this by booting into games and letting it run, usually no more than 10 minutes. It has also been caused by the Windows experience index CPU test. \u000a\u000a**Error information**: The Windows log reports Kernel-Power errors. Usually the bugcode is 0, but I have also seen it report bugcode 80 and bugcode 209. Both of those seem to indicate general hardware failure.   \u000a\u000aThere is nothing to suggest that my system is overheating. My first suspicion was that I'm just not getting enough power from the PSU, but it seems that others have used this PSU in similar configurations so that might not be it. Does anyone have suggestions on how to troubleshoot this?\u000a\u000a\u000a

VWhere did you get EBH as the second cheapest sprinter? Sure you didn't mean second most expensive sprinter?\u000a\u000aThat's also a hell of a low price for Bos. A surepick on any bunch sprint stages. Petit at just about 3 Mil is the cheapest sprinter of them all.
p2103
sI2
V* Not sure if he will sprint but Ramon Sinkeldam is only 3 points too and quite fast. If have no idea what he can do against the other sprinters though. Argos also has Janse Van Rensburg who is quite fast too.\u000a\u000a* Also Michel Kreder (3.2p) is cheap, he can do well in the slighty uphill sprints.\u000a\u000a* Barry Markus is not expensive either, 6.9 points. He was third in the scheldeprijs behind Kittel and Cav so he can sprint.\u000a\u000aEdit: A [Sprinters team probably looks something like this](http://imgur.com/UO65URr).

VI think the sprints can be really fun this year, because we don't have the surefire favourites to win, ie. Greipel, Cav, Sagan, Kittel. \u000a\u000aBut there's not a lot of stages for them to do it, so let's hope we get the right picks straight away. \u000a\u000aI've noticed that Markus fellow, and I think he's going to join me on a few days during the Vuelta... Along with Bos, Petit and EBH.  Not familiar with Sinkeldam or Kreder, but we'll see after the first few days how they hold up.\u000a\u000a

VI too expect more from Markus than from Sinkeldam and Kreder.\u000a\u000aEdit: I found an interview with Sinkeldam. He said:\u000a\u000a> The team takes Arndt, Janse van Rensburg and me to the Vuelta. I seem to be the best on the flat stages, so I will get played out there. For the more difficult stage we will aim for Janse van Rensburg or Arndt.\u000a\u000aSame story as Denegkolb and Kittel in the Tour.

VI like the concept of MOBA games a lot, but I've never been able to get into them. The main reason for this is because of the control scheme, which is basically taken from the RTS genre. This makes sense, since DOTA started as a Warcraft 3 mod, but now that a lot of MOBA games are being made as standalone games, I don't understand why they're all adopting the same RTS-like controls. Since you're only controlling a single person, it seems like it would make much more sense to have the game play like an ARPG (Diablo). What do you guys think? Do you like the RTS controls, or do you think it would be better with something else? Are there any MOBAs I don't know about that are using different controls?
p2109
sI1
VOther MOBA games (like League of Legends) do away with control groups. The few characters that do have pets have either simplistic AI (follow/attack) or can be controlled by Alt + Right-Click.
p2110
sI2
VRight, limiting their use.  The reason why DoTA still has control groups is because it's extremely vital to the characters using them to micro them properly.\u000a\u000aWhereas Tibbers just has a fire shield basic attack, it's important for Chen to manage all 3 minions he controls during a team fight.
p2111

VHello Reddit I have a question about my testosterone levels. When I was younger around 16 I visited an endo professor at a university to have my hormones checked out. He said my blood protein bindings were puzzling and to never get on testosterone replacement therapy. Fast forward to today I no longer have him as my doctor and have been seeing another endo doctor who says I do need replacement therapy; however I'm more inclined to trust the professor as he dedicates his life to his study. \u000a\u000aAnyway can anyone make sense of this? I'm not asking for medical advise simply some insight so I can ask my doctor in an informed manor. Since starting Androgel I have started to develop a bad case of gyno that won't come off and I'm concerned that it will get even worse =( My current doctor told me it's normal to have some breast development in males :/ Prior to starting the Androgel I didn't really have any symtoms of low T, no ED or anything like that. I also have hypothyroidism if that helps.\u000a\u000aI was around 16 when I had these taken:\u000a\u000aALBUMIN,SERUM: 5.1 g/dL\u000aReference Range: 3.6-5.1\u000aSAMPLE SLIGHTLY LIPEMIC.\u000a\u000aTESTOSTERONE, BIOAVAILABLE: 129.3 ng/dL\u000aReference Range: 8.0-210.0\u000a\u000aTESTOSTERONE, FREE: 55.8 pg/mL\u000aReference Range: 4.0-100.0\u000a\u000aSHBG: 5 nmol/L \u000aReference Range 11-71\u000a\u000aTESTOSTERONE, TOTAL 176 ng/dL\u000aReference Range: 1000 OR LESS\u000a\u000a
p2123

VI was prescribed it at 20 I was told in this case at 16 that I'd didn't need test and that this was normal. I also have hypothyroidism. About a year ago I put on a lot of extra weight  and went from 160 lbs (5"10) to almost 230lbs out of no where there seemed to be no cause for the weight gain. At around this time I was diagnosed with non-alcoholic liver disease out of no where.  Fast forward to today and I have been able to lose most of the weight but I didn't really change my diet or exercise pattern. I am currently about 170lbs and I can't gain or lose weight regardless of calorie intake it seems. \u000a\u000aI do think I have a couple of relatives on my dads side of the family with diabetes, scary stuff. As far as symptoms I've had episodes where I get blurred vision and my perception seems dulled, ever since about 16 I have never been the same, I thought I had a stroke the first time this happened, I have since had an MRI and CT which ruled this out.\u000a\u000aAs far as A.I's I have tried Letrozole which was probably pretty stupid but I wanted to give it a go to see if it would help with the gyno. It did reduce if by about half but then i stopped seeing progress around two weeks in. I was running about 2.5mg which seemed high. The side effects in my case were horrible hot flashes and I kept waking up 3-4 times per night.\u000a\u000aThanks for the insight I now have some questions to ask my doctor. I might even try and find another as the doctors in the Texas panhandle seem to have got their M.D off the back of a serial box. \u000a\u000aI wish I had a more recent lab with SHBG results but the lab results I've received from my doctor aren't very detailed and only say I have a test level of 127 which was prior to starting the Androgel.
p2124
sI2
VSeems like you know a lot more than I assumed. Sorry, I wasn't trying to talk down to you. So what is your biggest concern right now? Hypothyroidism can affect your T3 and T4 levels which will have a direct result on weight and metabolic rate. As for the diabetes as long as you're aware, it can be controlled. Many studies have shown a low carb diet such as a ketogenic diet and regular exercise can increase insulin sensitivity. As far as the gyno, letro is somewhat of a last result to try to reverse it and it seems it didn't work. Surgery might be your answer in that case. 
p2125
sI3
VSorry if I came off as arrogant I really didn't mean it. I was simply concerned that I might not need the TRT, seems I was wrong though and my current doctor is right. I don't currently have diabetes (hope I don't get them) Hard to believe that a university professor might have had it wrong all these years, anyway thanks a lot for your input, it really helped.
p2126
sI4
VNo man, it's a good thing; you're educated. Get another blood test done and post the results. Each clinic has its own range of acceptable limits and each doctor has his or her own opinion on HRT. When you do your test, have your blood drawn first thing in the morning as this is when test levels are highest and it will give the most accurate results. Depending on your results and lifestyle, there may be a way to naturally increase your test levels/GH levels through diet and exercise. If not, TRT may be the way to go. On a subreddit called r/steroids, majority of people will advocate for TRT and its benefits. I hopefully won't have to cross that bridge for another 10 years. So in conclusion, I would get a proper blood test that is recent and go from there

VBackground: I am one of the highest level members of the SRS "fempire". I have contributed a lot of my time towards SRS. I have contributed to SRS itself, the various related subreddits, external websites, IRC, and more.\u000a\u000aBut recent events have disturbed me. I disagree with censorship and specifically, I disagree with underhanded tactics to censor people. Some of the tactics used are so heinous that they are actually heartbreaking as you will see.\u000a\u000aTo be clear: the content of /r/n****ers (hereafter referred to as The Subreddit) was disturbing and wrong on many levels. I am not defending it.\u000a\u000aThat being said, I am writing this so that everyone is aware of what has happened, and the manipulation of this website and its administrators that has taken place.\u000a\u000aFirst of all, the reason The Subreddit was banned was because the administrators were offended by it or were manipulated into wanting it banned. All other reasons are simply rationalizations for the ban.\u000a\u000aPeople are saying that it was for brigading or threats or some other violations. This is all false.\u000a\u000aIf those were the reasons, then there would be no reason to ban the several replacements and related subreddits that have popped up. For example, /r/groids, /r/ChuckSpears, /r/diversity, /r/OffensiveThings, and several others. Why? Because whatever accusations of rules violations that The Subreddit may be guilty of, these subreddits only existed for hours or days before they were banned. They weren't even alive long enough to violate any rules.\u000a\u000aSo it's quite obvious that "rules" have nothing to do with any bans. Plain and simple, it's censorship. In the sidebar of The Subreddit there was a link to a Chinese anti-Black racist discussion group. When Americans are less tolerant of free speech than the Chinese, I cannot sit idly by.\u000a\u000aThe reasons for this censorship are even more disturbing. First of all, the "free speech" principles that reddit was founded on are completely gone. There are newer administrators that do not even understand these principles. They will non-nonchalantly delete things they don't like without a care in the world.\u000a\u000aSecondly, there are a few administrators that are SRSers. This has long been suspected but I know for a fact that it is true. To be fair to them, they have been hesitant to directly act on the wishes of SRS.\u000a\u000aBut that is where the most disturbing facts of them all comes into play: the ongoing campaign of manipulations and lies.\u000a\u000aFor several months, there has been a concerted effort to create false evidence in order to get support for banning The Subreddit. The "brigading" charge was drummed up. Everyone knows that linking to other subreddits is allowed, which is why /r/bestof and SRS itself are not banned.\u000a\u000aBut what people *don't* know is that SRSers were going into The Subreddit, following the links, and adding more downvotes than the "natural" denizens of The Subreddit were adding.\u000a\u000aThe goal of this was to get The Subreddit banned, but that didn't work, because the mods installed a policy of no meta-links, and this was convincing enough that some administrators (the ones not part of the manipulation) decided to let it go.\u000a\u000aNow here is the most hilarious part. First of all, "brigading" was never the primary focus of The Subreddit. If you ever went to it, before the "brigading" drama, probably 95% of all content was links to articles, pictures, videos, and self posts. After the new rule, 100% of all content were these things. None of those things are against the rules. Seeing as how "brigading" was already a concept associated with The Subreddit, and is "against the rules", the SRS manipulators had to latch onto this idea and drive it home.\u000a\u000aThen we have The Website (rni**ers.com). If you go there, you will see that it's 90% spam and 5% ghost town. There are a few posts but most of the legitimate discussion ended 20-30 days ago. The Website was never linked to anywhere on reddit except as evidence of off-site brigading. Meanwhile, SRS itself has several off-site places (forums, IRC) where threads and comments are linked to every single day.\u000a\u000aSeveral accounts were created, made to look legitimate, and then used for rules violations. E.g., sending threatening private messages. One SRSer would create a fake account, send threats to another SRSer, and then the recipient would report it. The manipulation was so easy that it was shocking. The naive administrators, because they are predictably anti-racist, believed everything.\u000a\u000aBut here is the worst part of all of this: some of the admins are SRSers, but AT LEAST one admin is "in love" with an SRS transsexual posing as a woman. This abdication of morality in the pursuit of censorship was the primary reason for me coming forward with this post. To the SRSers, manipulating someone like this is funny. They laugh about it. Private communications are shared and laughed at.\u000a\u000aAll of this "evidence" combined with being tired of hearing about it pushed administrators over the edge and they decided to take action. The SRS admins had the green light and went full-on gung-ho with all of the censorship that they had been dying to do for months.\u000a\u000aMany have said they don't care, and good riddance. The thing is, in a few years, who knows what the attitudes of the administrators will become. Maybe some MRAs will come into power and decide to ban SRS (even easier to drum up "brigading" charges than The Subreddit). Maybe some religious people or marketing people will come into power and ban the NSFW subs. When the content of the website is decided by the administrators instead of the people, you invite a situation that few will agree with. And frankly, the underhanded, opaque nature of all of this should be fishy enough that there are things going on that are highly disagreeable. The administrators should make a public statement about what is going on.\u000a\u000aIf posting offensive pictures gets your subreddit banned, then orchestrating a campaign of lies and manipulation targeted at the site administrators should be even more reason to get your subreddit banned.\u000a\u000aI will remain active in the SRS community, and they will never find out who I am. If more disturbing information comes to light I will share it.\u000a\u000aCOPY THIS POST, IT WILL BE DELETED

VMy previous post was a video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxLPlyn5SCU ) asking for help. Thanks to all of your feedback and the feedback of people on Youtube, I managed to tackle the bind. The next day I decided to observe how my moves looked on camera and have identified some sticking points.\u000a\u000aHow do I ensure that the arc my yoyo takes when I perform the trapeze move is round and doesn't have a weird kink in it? (particularly noticeable at 1.13)\u000aIs there a recommended way to bind the yoyo, particularly after the trapeze?\u000aOther than experience, is there a way to immediately know before a knot will be created before it actually does?\u000a\u000aAlso what new moves should I look at as an upgrade from split the atom and the trapeze?\u000a\u000aHelp as always is appreciated.

p2153
sI1
VGood advice here. Another point I'd like to add is to continue improving your throw. The stronger you can throw, the faster the yoyo will be spinning, making it easier for you to bind more cleanly. \u000a\u000a\u000aKnots from binds tend to happen more if the yoyo isn't spinning very fast, meaning that it takes a bigger "loop" to create enough friction to bind. 
p2154

VFaster spin, more pull, less chance for randomness, less chance for knots. Gotcha.\u000a
p2155

VKeep in mind fast spins also mean a tighter and harder bind. If you have any tension at all and that creates a knot around the yoyo the harder throw will then bounce the yoyo back into your body/face and could hurt.\u000a\u000aIt's always good to do a very little throw if you have even the smallest thought that you might have a knot.\u000a\u000a

VSuppose I am buying a Copper and have 2 Traders in my hand. Can I use both simultaneously and instead of gaining the Copper, gain 2 silvers? Or do they have to be used one after the other - replacing the Copper with a Silver and then replacing the Silver with another Silver - leaving me with only 1 silver?
p2167
sI1
Vyeah you play one card then the other.  so you would buy a copper then reveal trader 1 and gain a silver instead.  then you reveal trader 2 and instead of gaining that silver you gain the next silver on the pile and put the first one back on top.
p2168
sI2
VAmusingly, you only need one Trader to do the same thing. You can reveal the same Reaction multiple times. (Mostly because it would be easy to cheat and do this anyway if it were illegal, since you only reveal them one at a time.) Most of the time either it doesn't matter or it's prevented by the card wording (e.g. Horse Traders, Beggar) but it can be useful to reveal Secret Chamber multiple times.\u000a\u000aThat said, I don't think this is right:\u000a\u000a>then you reveal trader 2 and instead of gaining that silver you gain the next silver on the pile and put the first one back on top.\u000a\u000aWouldn't this mean you could use Trader as (almost) a Watchtower if there was only one Silver left in the Supply? Or for that matter you could *always* use it as Watchtower by revealing it eighty times in a row? And there's no rule that says cards that "are gained" or "would be gained" are ever "set aside" in the meantime. I have to think you just get the same copy of Silver, even though it makes the word "instead" look a little silly in Trader's text.
p2169
sI3
Vthe easy answer to the OP's question, you get one not two.  the hard answer is you can cycle through the entire silver deck if you wanted the bottom one but there is really no point to do it multiple times other than to take up more time.
p2170
sI4
VBut you're missing my point. If you could cycle through the entire Silver deck and get to the bottom, then what would happen when you reveal it one more time and try to gain a Silver but there are none left in the pile? You would fail and not gain anything. This would be quite useful in cases where you don't want to gain a Curse but you also don't want Silver! \u000a\u000aNow surely Trader can't be used this way. But what's stopping you? I think what's stopping you is that if you reveal Trader multiple times, you still just get the same Silver card that was initially on top of the pile. And I think that makes sense because why would that card not still be on top of the pile? There's no rule that says it should have moved elsewhere (for instance, have been "set aside").
p2171
sI5
Vactually i do not think you can shuffle through the entire deck.  i cant find a rule or debate on this topic.  i do not use goko but on isotropic it only let you do this type of thing X times, where X was the number of players.  so like if you were attacked and had a moat, you would reveal moat.  it would then ask you if you wanted to reveal moat 4 more times before it stopped asking you in a 5 player game.  it would ask you 3 additional times in a 4 player game and so on.  alternatively you could reveal it once and then say no the second time and be done.

VI did expect her to go out and do that. It is literally a meme in this sub how Ronda has sloppy striking and lets he chin hang out, and it's known she doesn't adjust her style.

p2194

VFair enough, who you got in the rematch?
p2195
sI5
VFrankly I'd have to pick Holly again. Ronda obviously has the talent and fighting spirit to win, but as long as she's with the same coaching team I really don't see her making the adjustments she needs to to win. Not to mention her seemingly broken mental state. \u000a\u000aI think Ronda would need to get the judo-equivalent of a flash-KO to beat Holly. Which is possible, but the longer the fight goes on the more it favors the more disciplined, better game-planned Holly.

VHi, I have a self-built computer dual boot Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04.  Recently I bought an external adapter to read and recover data off of old drives.\u000a\u000aWorked just fine for the modern 1 Terabyte SATA HDD, (I used DriveImage XML to recover files).\u000a\u000aI have two older 40-GB PATA drives that seem OK from a hardware perspective, and when I connect them to windows they show up in devices, but don't get mounted.  I think they are both formatted windows XP.\u000a\u000aIn linux I can create a disk image (.img), and transfer them over to my windows partition, but when I try to mount the image it says "The disk image file is corrupted".  Linux can mount the image but doesn't recognize the format.  DriveImage XML doesn't recognize the file as something it can open (I think because it is not mounted).\u000a\u000aIs there other software I can use to read this file?\u000a\u000a**Edit:** The two drives were in RAID setup.  Downloaded ReclaiMe RAID recovery and was able to get an image file written and mounted.  Thanks to all who replied.
p2238
sI1
VYes, that's how I have the windows partitions on my computer mounted to linux.  I believe I tried this, but don't recall the result.  One sec while I flip over to linux to try this again.\u000a\u000aEdit: Well the first consideration on the page you linked regards using the file manager, which is how I was able to get disk images in the first place.  But going back to the physical drives, the site you linked says:\u000a\u000a> If your blkid output does not include partition labels, this means that the partitions do not have labels and you will have to determine which partition you wish to mount by another means.\u000a\u000awhich is the case for the drive in question.  Unfortunately the page doesn't seem to say what those other means are.  I assume it would involve the direct path, in my case /dev/sdd but i don't know the proper syntax to use.  Also, it seems to recognize a drive at first and then stop recognizing it when I swap out another.  So I will maybe have to restart if I want it to be able to read the drive again.\u000a\u000aAnother problem is that the drives are not showing up as type NTFS but rather type "silicon_medley_raid_member".  Which is odd because I know at least one of them was formatted with windows XP.
p2239
sI2
VHmm, it should be able to mount these drives out of the box. Try running the command: "dpkg -l ntfs-3g" in a command prompt. This will tell you if the package needed for reading NTFS drives is installed. If so...\u000a\u000aHave you tried the instructions in the "Manual Configuration" section? They walk you through how to find your device labels and create your own mount points for them.\u000a\u000aThe ID's on the drives might behave unusually because you're not hooking them directly into the system, you're hooking them up to an external adapter. The "silicon_medley_raid_member" may be some ID for the adapter, or a generic ID that it gives to drives it can't recognize.\u000a\u000aIt's pretty common for external adapters to behave oddly when you swap drives. You shouldn't have to restart the whole computer, just try unplugging the adapter, and connecting the next drive to it before plugging it back into the computer.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Just had another idea. If the drives report being "raid_members", they may indeed be just that, individual drives from a RAID array. If so, you won't be able to read any data from them without using the original RAID controller. Do you remember where the drives came from?

VHiya! My name's Anastasia, but most of the people that know me here and in the skype group call me nankazz or kittenkazz. I'm a newbie at conlanging, but it's an activity I really enjoy. \u000a\u000aIf you've been able to reach this point without boring your skulls out, i'll talk a little about it.\u000a\u000aLately I've been working on my language a lot. It used to be called Arizijin [a.\u027ei.zi.\u0292in], which became Arijzijin [a.\u027ei:.zi:.in], then [a.\u027eaj.zaj.in]. It was originally meant to be an a posteriori auxlang based on spanish, english, french, japanese, chinese, and russian. I'd pick the most commonly repeated, and sometimes words from different languages were united. If none of the words were similar in different languages, I wouldn pick the shortest or nicest one. It failed, however, and became a kitchen-sink relex. It looked something like this:\u000a\u000aBoku taberu die zeitik.\u000a\u000a1sg eat the newspaper (sorry for improper glossing)\u000a\u000aI was (kind of) happy with it, but i got tired, as creating words was long  and boring. You had to look up words in 5 languages just to choose one. I also realized my method was flawed, so I decided to give it another go, and start over.\u000a\u000aI decided to switch from an isolating language to a synthetic one, and started to switch from a posteriori to a priori. The language reached a point in which it stopped being an auxlang, and became a sort of artlang(I really don't know what the hell it was back then).

VSorry for not answering earlier!  Actually. nowadays japanese uses katakana and hiragana, two different system that derive from man'yogana due to simplification. Man'yogana actually uses normal chinese logograms for their phonetic value. I simplefied the amount of characters, and only use 80, instead of the several hundred that were used in classical japanese. Nominative isn't expressed, as it's the "default" case, and accusative is marked by adding -in or -n to the word's ending. There's also a conditional case, that's marked with -nya at the end. I couldn't really explain it throughly... Well, basically, it indicates that something may only happen if another criterion is met, or to express a wish. I realize this would be best expressed by more than one case, but oh well.
p2247
sI2
VThat's actually extremely interesting. It sounds like you've taken the romantic conditional/subjunctive, removed them from verbs and applied them to nouns instead. That's really neat, but I would get confused quickly.\u000a\u000aI imagine it has a much more rich nominal morphology than verbal considering you stressed how easily verbs conjugate.\u000a\u000a Do you have traditional adjectives, or are there japanese i style adjectives that can also be somewhat of a stative verb? Or both?
p2248
sI3
VAdjectives are pretty normal, actually. Most verbs have an -en ending, and all adjectives have an -an ending. And yeah,  the nominal morphology *is* a lot richer than the verbal one. Nouns *may* decline according to number, and they always decline according to case. (Sorry if i didn't understand something, I'm a total noob :P)

VI just picked up a decommissioned server, sonicwall TZ105 and 24 port gigabit switch to start my homelab but I have a few questions.     \u000a      \u000aThe server is a Dell PowerEdge 1950. The only thing I know about it yet(as I haven't started it up or anything) is that it has dual xeons, dual gigabit nics and what looks like mostly full ram slots. I also noticed the front hotswappable drive caddies say SAS/SATAu so my question is, can I run SATA drives in here to save money? SAS are rather expensive and my plan is to run multiple VMs and I only have two 73GB SAS drives.\u000a\u000aI have the service tag if that helps anyone in answering my question.
p2269

VThats the thing, I cant see how a 3.5 would fit through the slot. Unless theres another location inside for hard drives. I confess it was dropped on my desk and I haven't even opened it up yet.

VWhat I'm looking for is a way to practice reading and writing kana really quickly on a desktop computer, with the chance of absorbing random vocab words along the way as a side effect.\u000a\u000aI use WaniKani already, but the going there is very slow. This is more of a supplement kind of thing to help with recognition level vocab reading that isn't based on multiple choice selection.\u000a\u000aIdeally I'd love to find:\u000a\u000a* Retyping something already on the screen, similar to a touch-typing training program\u000a* Kana words/sentences that also show equivalent kanji and approximate english translation\u000a* Options for randomized typefaces, to helps practice recognizing incomplete and distorted characters \u000a* SRS style distribution so it won't show you the same ones too much.\u000a* Vocab sets from games so I can later practice in the "wild", e.g. Japanese releases of Pokemon.\u000a* Takes japanese input from a desktop computer\u000a* Simple user interface, rather than gamified like Typing of the Dead\u000a\u000aIs my best bet a custom Anki deck?
p2277
sI1
VMainly that I'm not sure of a way to get it to randomize the typeface.
p2278
sI2
VBut you wanted an srs? Srs and random do not lend themselves to each other. I would check out the shared anki decks and if not custom make one for yourself.
p2279
sI3
VWith what I have in mind, the font is random but the card (vocab) is not and uses a very loose srs that expects lots of repetiton in a short timeframe rather than the usual anki style spacing.\u000a\u000aIf anki cards take simple code (if random_number == 4 then use font_4) this could be done within a card.\u000a\u000aEdit: Looked it up. Anki supports javascript so there may be something possible there.
p2280
sI4
VHonestly my advice to you is that this is not worth the effort. If you just learn the kana with proper stroke order that will help you with reading far more than doing recognition with multiple fonts. Move past drilling kana as quickly as possible, it's the easiest part of Japanese. You should pretty much take a weekend to learn them, at most.
p2281
sI5
VI'm coming from a point of view where I've been familiar with all the kana and a few hundred kanji at varying degrees for a while now, but with an annoyingly small vocabulary. I'm curious about this as an alternate way to build vocab alongside WaniKani decks, manga and so on.\u000a\u000aWhile it might seem like potentially a lot of effort, if Anki does support simple scripting in cards and embedded typefaces, then the effort randomize them could actually be fairly trivial. \u000a\u000aI haven't poked around in the card creation options for a while, but it sounds like that might be my next step.

My concern is that we know that there's a certain type of person, who, if you say something that they don't agree with, or get into a dispute with, might just be tempted to just go to the subreddits that you moderate and start stirring up shit there.

VI think he's refering to the fact that Kingdoms is an action rpg with dodge button. I would say possibly similar gw2 is a actionmmo/mmorpg hybrid in a way it won't be exactly like it because KoA was stupidly easy because there was no form of cool down on the dodge and all the attacks were just chains based on your weapon. Gw2 does the based on your weapon kind of thing but they skills are more diverse than a 1-2-3 attack with the third being flashy and strong (though some classes "1" slot skill follows this) in KoA its 1-2-3 maybe throw a lightening bolt but mostly 1-2-3. 
p2301

VI barely use 1-2-3(-4) on my character because often i find mobs at my level counter the 1-2-3-4 system.\u000a\u000aI must admit i dodge/blink a lot though, but i quite enjoy that.
p2302
sI3
VWell you will have the dodge, and blinks/jumps are also secondary skills on some classes but all things (save dodging because that has a resource mechanic behind it) have cool-downs attached to them. So quite like kingdoms you can choose to target something or just kind of swing and hit stuff and dodge when enemies attack and when engaging a monster its best (in most cases) to try to kite them a little (where as in guildwars2 it'd be more like a lot-tle kiting) but there will be a lot more diversity in what you can actually do to mobs as I'm sure you would expect. Also it'd be good to note that like most rpgs recently there is a talent system but its a lot different from say oA or really any mmo I can think of. I suggest if you're in the mood to read, reading [This](http://www.guildwars2guru.com/forum/guild-wars-2-mass-info-t25557.html) and possibly playing around with this [Thing](http://www.gw2tools.com/#) or this thing [as well](http://gw2.luna-atra.fr/skills_tool/)

VNo. All firebase does is give you a database that is really easy to access and use cross platform. So from your Python program that gets you coffee pot fullness, you can update a value in Firebase. You can then get that value with javascript and display it on your website.

VHi all. To start, I'm a 17 year old girl and I've been taking Microgestin (birth control pill) for almost a year. A couple weeks ago I forgot to take my pill in the morning and had sex that afternoon. Unfortunately, I only remembered later that night.\u000aI took two pills the following morning, which is what my doctor said to do if I missed a dose. I'm now on the third day of my placebo week and my period still hasn't come. Is it probable that I'm pregnant? If so, what the fuck do I do?

VThe addition operation of a ring, taken alone, must be a commutative group operation on the underlying set. The commutativity of addition is not what distinguishes a field from a ring\u2014addition must be commutative in both.\u000a\u000aWhat distinguishes a field from a ring is the existence of multiplicative inverses and the requirement that multiplication must be commutative (and, depending on your definition of ring, possibly the existence of a multiplicative identity, and possibly the requirement that the multiplicative identity must be distinct from the additive identity).

VAs the title suggests we have a flooding problem in south east michigan.  The beaver dams are in the county drain and can be seen from space (google earth).\u000a\u000aCounty says no money to remove.  State Rep. said we should sell so county can use land for road expansion they want.  We are the little guys that live next to the rich subdivision with Eminem and other multimillion dollar home owners just across the drain.\u000a\u000aOurs is a historic home built from solid stone and slate, so the flooding is not wiping us out, which seems to be angering the powers that be.\u000a\u000aWe cannot find a local attorney to help (afraid it seems) and when we tried to remove some of the dam material we were threatened with arrest.\u000a\u000aRight now we are doing what we can to slow the attack with shovels and other hand tools as the county said no to a seawall.  The township is the largest in the state and would be on our side, but the land is owned by the county until we become a city.  Treasurer told us the tax benefits would go away for the township if we incorporated into a city.\u000a\u000aState flood engineer came out to see what we had done to protect the land from erosion BY HAND and said she was impressed and saddened she could not help and whispered that it is political and her hands are tied.\u000a\u000aI'm a single female home owner by the way.  Owned property and it's three acres since 1988, taxes paid in full and flood insurance paid every May.\u000a\u000aEdit:  Also our insurance company paid the full value of our barn because the new road the county built recently, drains into it, we had to build a berm to redirect the water around the building.  The opposite side of the property has road run off pouring into the house foundation from the new road.  We have sand bags we put across the driveway each time it rains more than a drizzle.  The insurance company said "The County means to ruin your house or at least it's value."
p2395
sI1
VThanks for the information, I wonder if there is any help the federal government can offer.  We went to our Senator Levin and his staff would not even open the door.  We spoke via close circuit television.  Their door was like a bank vault.\u000a\u000aTold to speak with our state Rep.  He was the one that told us to sell and make everyone's life easy.  "If you become too much of a pain, they will just take the land as a nuisance property, eminent domain, they will find something."
p2396
sI2
VProbably not.  You can look into it, but I don't know of any federal programs that would apply.\u000a\u000aIf your insurance company isn't pointing you in a helpful direction, there probably is no cost-effective solution.  They are not omniscient, but they do have a vested interest in helping you protect your property.\u000a\u000aIf you PM me google earth or property appraisers information for your property, I might be able to give you some ideas to help mitigate the water problem.  
p2397
sI3
VI just got a PM saying I need to apply for assistance from FEMA.  They will put the Army Corp. of Engineers onto the beaver dam first and then raise my house with them paying most of the cost.  \u000a\u000aEdit:  We've already been told by the flood engineer for the state what needs to be done, but she says the permits will never be authorized no matter how many studies we pay for.  It's political and until democrats regain control of Michigan, wealth will trump righteousness.  She's ready to give up the states and move back to where her family is from.  (MiddleEastern)
p2398
sI4
VThere are ways of protecting limited structures that get around the permitting process.  \u000a\u000aDecorative planters, for instance, set back outside the roadway and drainage easement, can serve as a de-facto retaining wall when filled with a clay core.  You still want sand right up against the blocks, and drains so the water between the clay core and the blocks can drain out on the side it came in.\u000a\u000aYou can also disguise french drains as flowerbeds - top with bark mulch and permeable landscape fabric they look very nice, they just happen to hide a stone bed holding a  12" liner wrapped perforate PTFE drain line. Put the actual plants in pots.\u000a\u000aIf you want to protect your house, you can ring it completely with the "planters."  Add a swale and a sump pump inside the planters and you can even stop the water backing up from the dam, at least up to the level of your clay core.  And since you aren't changing the way the water runs off your property, you won't need a permit.\u000a\u000aHowever, nothing you do will stop the state from taking your land if they want it.  Michigan has a pretty crappy eminent domain law: http://eminentdomain.uslegal.com/state-laws-on-eminent-domain/michigan/.  However, the more improvements you make to the property, the more you can force them to pay, since they have to pay fair market value.\u000a\u000a

VYou should see what I've already done and I would hope you would pat me on the back.  Had a guy from the town keep repeating, landscaping, you need to learn all there is about it.  I need to read up about french drains.\u000a\u000aEdit:  I had an offer from the County to put in a road drain halfway into my property and if I agreed then I would be signing all rights away to sue about any problems past, present or future.  Jammed in my mailbox in a manila envelope with no return address or postage.  Just my name scrawled in pencil.   Reminded me of The Sopranos.\u000a\u000aNeedless to say I am dealing with power and money.  Scary stuff.

VI've been thinking of spending some time in front of a simulator.  Can I pick your brain?\u000a\u000aI only have a few hours of training, my instructor is going to be out of town for a week and a half, my approaches aren't very stable, and my radio calls sound like a middle-school student asking a girl on a first date, so I'd like to find a way to improve in between lessons.\u000a\u000aI have a USB flight yoke with a throttle, a fast computer with a good video card, and a full-HD projector.  Do you think it would be worth setting up FlightGear, and doing a bunch of touch-and-gos?\u000a\u000aOf course I don't have any motion simulation, but I have a large enough projection screen that if I sit close enough, it almost feels like the room is moving around.\u000a\u000aI don't have any pedals, and I haven't practiced coordinated turns in a real aircraft.  I can borrow some pedals if I it makes a difference.  I'm also pretty bad at taxiing; do you think practicing in a simulator would help?\u000a\u000aI am training on a Cessna 152, but FLightGear only has a 172SP and a partially complete 150.  Need I worry about the differences in the rather similar aircraft?
p2404
sI2
VOut of curiosity, why FlightGear rather than FSX or X-Plane? I've mainly played FSX, so I'm not an expert on the differences between them, but when I tried FlightGear (admittedly quite a while ago), I didn't feel like it was as good as FSX. Just my personal opinion.\u000a\u000aAs for your real question, I think it might help a bit. I played a lot of flight simulators before doing any kind of real training, and it helped me because it meant I already had a lot of the knowledge you need, and knew what to expect, but I still don't really think it feels the same as a real plane. The difference between simulator and real life will probably dwarf the difference between a Cessna 150 and 172. The thing the simulator is best for is learning the procedural things like checklists.\u000a\u000aYou shouldn't worry so much about it though, if you only have a few hours it's normal for your approaches etc. to be a bit rubbish. I know mine were. A few more hours in the air and you'll probably find that you're a LOT better at these things, and generally a lot more confident. Same with your taxiing skills.\u000a\u000aKeep it up and good luck!

Now for /dev/urandom:\u000a\u000a    # dd bs=4096 if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda\u000a    dd: error writing \u2018/dev/sda\u2019: No space left on device\u000a    488378647+0 records in\u000a    488378646+0 records out\u000a    2000398934016 bytes (2.0 TB) copied, 118225 s, 16.9 MB/s\u000a\u000aJust under 33 hours... I knew it was going to be slower but not *that* much slower.  It's a standard mechanical hard drive so it shouldn't be doing any of that compression SSDs do with the /dev/zero pass.\u000a\u000aAlso the dd process was maxing out a single core of my quad core CPU.  I have an Intel Core i5 2500K so I wouldn't think my CPU would be a bottleneck here but you never know... not sure why else it would be maxed.  Is there a way to make it utilize more than one core if that's the case?\u000a\u000aAnother thing I was considering was Frandom.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.billauer.co.il/frandom.html\u000a\u000ahttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Frandom\u000a\u000aHas anyone here used Frandom before?  My purpose would be to prep a drive for encryption.  If you don't fill a drive with random data, it becomes possible to tell what parts of the drive have data on them based on the theory that it's impossible to tell random data from encrypted data.  I know /dev/urandom is probably a better randomizer but will Frandom be good enough for this purpose?

The various Haggen Food Grocery Stores (the actual name, not just Haggen) will always be DarkHaggens, BarkHaggens and FairHaggens. And never, ever will I call The State Street Bar by its given name; it will forever live in my heart and the hearts of many as The Old Beaver or just The Beav. It's good of you to try to keep us rebels on the righteous path, but some of us willfully transgress. See you at The Beav!

VIt is funny how every city/state/region has their own colloquial usages like that. \u000a\u000aI exclusively use the term "Old Beav" to describe The Bar With The Dumbest Name In Town, and conversely "New Beav" is still in my vernacular even though it has been a few years since the "new" part was valid.\u000a\u000aBut I bristle whenever I hear "Haggen's" and Fred Meyer's"--SPARE ME THE FUCKING POSSESSIVE "S"!!!!

VI'm sneaking around, stealthing away. Ellie keeps getting up and running directly in front of an enemy, which conveniently ignores her, running around all willy nilly. As soon as I make a sound they scream and start charging at me. I get the impression she is meant to be stealthy when I am stealthy, but something about the room layout causes her to get up and run directly in the enemies faces, who can't see her. And it happens all the time. \u000a\u000aI only point this out because not one of the thousands of glowing, 10/10 reviews I have read has ever mentioned this pretty big oversight. In the scheme of things it doesn't matter, but it keeps taking me out of the immersion of the game, kind of ruins the tension.\u000a\u000aI still think this is a great game, awesome incredible graphics, great story excellent acting etc... but doesanyone else notice this happening?\u000a\u000a**I haven't yet finished the game so please no ending spoilers!**

VDear Americans, no one is coming to take your guns. Why do you fear small provisions as if it's the end of the world? I have no studies or polls I trust so I\u2019m not going to put any numbers up but, can you guys just please see this from outside the box for one sec?\u000a\u000aEverywhere there are stricter gun laws, gun deaths are lower. Even if you want to hunt, who needs 30 bullets to stop a deer? You will still have the access and ability to buy guns. If the federal government banned the carrying of handguns, won't mean you can't have your handgun. I just never understood the mentality of "I need my AR-15, 500 round, suppressor, laser sited, grenade launching, and exploding bullet gun to protect my family."\u000a\u000aYou guys seem to think that once someone becomes president, they become a foreigner and want to break the laws. Obama is just as American as Ronald Reagan, as was Lincoln. The government is not going to take the guns. And if they do I think it will be a little more obvious; and if that day comes, sure, start your rebellion. I'm sure when four score and seven years ago the fore-fathers drafted the constitution, they had no idea muskets would turn into 30 round AK-47 rifles. They wrote this amendment for MUSKETS. I bet 100 bucks if they were alive today they'd be ashamed, and re-write the rules to be something about owning 5 clip mag rifle. Something to stall an enemy force till the real military could arrive.\u000a\u000aAnother note I never got was, the constitution says "Arms for a well-regulated militia." Not "Everyone has guns yay, shoot thy neighbor if he walks on your lawn." Militia: (Noun) a military force that is raised from the civil population to supplement a regular army in an emergency. How is Bill down the street a militia? I'm sorry but I don't see the downside to having an AR-15 with a 5 clip mag, which can't be held in public and has to be stored away properly as a bad thing. You can still hunt, you can still defend your family, you can still form a militia.\u000a\u000aBut then again I'm Canadian... what do I know.\u000a\u000aTLDR: Calm your tits, no one is taking your guns, the Government is not waging war against the people, and you have a massive gun problem.\u000a\u000aPSS: If you know the proper form this should be posted in, please let me know. And i'm being 100% sincere when I wrote this.

The entire framework of the Constitution, as originally written, was to reduce the impact of the commons.  Senators were chosen by state legislatures.

VOh ok I see , now.\u000aThat is very true I'm actually disappointed I'm having to upgrade my PC just to use this product.\u000aI was using prismatik before ambi box the problem was prismatik couldn't do full screen games so I went with ambi box and got playclaw but now the CPU is bottle necking hardcore. \u000aSo my solution is going to wipe out my PC to make sure no hidden viruses on it, and to get rid of dumb and unnecessary files.\u000aI'll try switching the USB port .

VI would avoid Templar because everyone will expect you lead as the tank and do important roles. \u000a\u000aOther than that, everything is pretty easy and smooth to level now. Magic ranged classes (ie sorcerer, spiritmaster, songweaver, gunslinger, cleric) will have the easiest time leveling and soloing but nothing is 'hard' and you'll fly through levels regardless. \u000a\u000aServers... Siel has more activity (at least Elyos side) but prices for things are bonkers insane and a lot of people are completely gear capped. It's the oldest server with the most population but as a new player you'll have a hard time starting out I think.\u000a\u000aBeritra is new and things are much cheaper in comparison. Still very active in terms of sieges and instances and stuff. For a new player it's way easier.

VSo here's how it is.  My girlfriend had a bad day at work, so I decided to cook for her when she got home.  I made some bomb ass Asian chicken and rice.  It was tasty as hell.  To spice it up, I sliced up a Thai chili pepper.\u000a\u000aI'm sure you can see where this is going.\u000a\u000aAfter we were done eating, we were lounging on the couch.  I had my legs crossed, and my boys were getting a bit squished, so I reached into me underwears and adjusted them.  A couple of minutes later, my sack got this burning, itching feeling.  I couldn't figure out what was going on for the life of me, but it went away.\u000a\u000aA little later, she went to the bathroom, so I decided that it was a good time to go digging for gold.  Don't look at me like that, we all do it.  Suddenly, the burning was back, but in my nostril.  It was at this point that I remembered that I neglected to wash my hands after the pepper.\u000a\u000aSo now my eyes are watering and my nose is on fire.  I'm an idiot.

V> I have been thinking of doing more overclocking would it be worth it to buy a more stable board and better cooler?\u000a\u000aIMO no, when you get your 300 card, try and see how far you can push it with your current setup. Spending +$100 on a new mobo(your cooler should be fine) wouldnt be worth it for a few extra 100 mhzs

So I'm gonna try dipping into chalice dungeons now. I just unlocked access to the hindertomb dungeon which I'll try today after work. However...\u000a\u000aI've come to notice I'm lacking alot of materials for these dungeons. Do I have to keep farming the pthermeru(SP?) Dungeon in order to get raw materials for the harder dungeons? I haven't been able to make a lower pthermeru dungeon yet due to lack of items. If I take away the central chalice and put it back will it respawn all the chests and items and shit for me? I'm having trouble finding ritual bloods and shit like that to do the harder dungeons cause I need a rank 15 bloodgem...\u000a\u000aAlso where the heck is the queen of yharnam boss, that's a trophy I need as well\u000a.\u000a\u000a

VSo like most of the people here, I do love the look of handsewns. I have worn them from many different companies, including some of the higher-end ones. My problem, however, is that after about 6 months, they become slippers for me. If they're unlined, which they usually are, they lose a lot of their shape, especially in the toe. I'd say the height of the toebox decreases by about half. All of the sudden, they look much more casual than when I bought them. I know they're inherently a casual style but I find it difficult to wear them to the very very business casual environment I work in. I'd be more than happy to plunk down 300 dollars on rancourts, if I knew that over the years they could maintain their shape after all the shit I'll put them through. Does anyone have any similar experience, or possible solutions? I've tried highland with walkover, and those basically became blobs after a few months. Is Rancourt better? 
p2588
sI1
VNo I don't. 
p2589
sI2
VYou should to help maintain the toe shape and prevent the toe curl that comes from use.\u000a\u000aI would size down in shoe tree size if possible for casual loafers as they lack laces, the CXL or Wine Cavalier is stretchier, and it's likely that the counter (the top of the hole that lets your feet in) will get stretched out too much. \u000a\u000aIf you can't size down because you have small feet, then just place the front of the shoe tree in without engaging the spring mechanism.
p2590
sI3
VI don't use trees, but I use a cloth I got from a company called Sanders, which you stuff into the casual or unlined shoes to help maintain shape. I've found it a bit more effective than shoe trees, which didn't really slow the collapse of the shape. 
p2591
sI4
VDo you have any photos of what you're describing? Personally, I have not experienced any collapse with occasional shoe tree use

sI3
VI've been running the beta on ultra at 1080 and getting a steady 60 fps.  All I've been hearing from others is terrible fps on many intel rigs.
p2614
sI4
VI've heard mixed results from both sides. It's a beta and it clearly does not run as it should on the hardware people have. A big part of those in the closed beta were already BF3 players (because Premium players got the closed beta) so those that are complaining most likely have no issues in BF3. BF3 is a walk in the park for my PC, but I get a lot stuttering in the beta.
p2615
sI5
VI think your original comment has been true.  Intel has better single core performance.  But I can't help but feel dev's are going to be taking better advantage of more cores moving forward.  BF4 may be a good example of that.\u000a\u000aRegardless of all this op will be very happy with either processor.

p2627

VWasn't there something to say they were both massively reduced in number and pretty degenerated also? Sheer lack of numbers probably means they'd be eager to get on any side and the sheer degeneration given by time and lack of Raziel probably means they're lost any pride they had and just want to get their next blood fix.\u000a\u000aOh how the mighty have fallen indeed.

And I would have to wait for Wind to give me the code. It's free, but I have to wait 6 months. \u000a\u000aA friend of mine is coming by tomorrow and she has a Telus SIM, I'm gonna try it out, maybe i'll get lucky, (doubtful). If not, then I'll try to unlock it and do the same later. \u000a\u000aFunny thing, this is the first time I buy a phone that's not unlocked, and this happens. Oy Vey.

VNone of the sites say they are compatible with the others. I usually look up specs on gsm arena. But most reports say it will work. Except Bell branded Z10s have the apn hardcoded, and i think even unlocking them won't change it. However bringing an unlocked Z10 into Bell should work. Keep in mind i am not 100%sure.

Vhey - \u000a\u000aI don't know how many of you use Blazersedge.com (it's a good site for Blazer news, local writing, etc), but lately it seems the Blazers' woes have started affecting the staff.\u000a\u000aI had my years-old account banned without explanation other than "ad hominem" attacks. When I wrote in to ask why, and even list some possible reasons why, I didn't get a reply.\u000a\u000aWhen my roommate decided to make an account so at least one of us could comment, they banned it too, thinking it was me making a new account.\u000a\u000aSince they don't respond to emails, I'd just like to throw out there that there are probably comments and posts that just... vanish. And there's no way to find out why. I know I'm pissed every time I hear reddit mods are taking stuff off, and so I thought I might give a heads up that your posts on there may get deleted if they have any twinge of negativity. An example of posts my friend thinks got me banned:\u000a\u000a- After a recap that included "PRAAIISE JAYYSUS," and a subsequent comment about Christians being offended by that line, I added that Christians "weren't really known for their critical thinking skills." Just sayin, I didn't start it... \u000a- A comment about the new videos being "lame," that they could be better, but needed work.\u000a- Comments about how the quality of the writing declined during the Blazers weeks-long slide.... they even alluded to the fact that the recap would be really short. Which is a long time to go without a decent recap for those who didn't catch the game.\u000a\u000aAll of these comments were deleted within a few minutes of posting... I know, them's fightin' words! But seriously, you'd have to have skin thinner than nori seaweed to ban a dude for that. Anyways, just a heads up... maybe I'm so used to reddit and actually being able to say things without fear of someone removing it that I'm insulated from how the rest of the Internet works. Anyways... go blazers!\u000a\u000aEDIT: I want to be clear: Blazersedge is a great site. Their writing is really, really good, the coverage is great. I think everyone here should check them out. I am just disappointed about this one aspect of the site, and wanted to share my experience.

I thought it was unfair and unjust, but I recognize their right to do it, and don't question that.

VI just upgraded and moved my naut mini to backup for the ceramic reason as well as the expense of the coils. I actually went with the lemo drop and just got it yesterday. Works great so far, no leaking issues that I'd read about. And the bottom hole I've found if you drip it slowly into the hole even with a nozzle too large it'll fill the tank, so filler bottles aren't necessary unless you're in a rush.

VI have two questions for you if you don't mind.\u000a\u000aWhat's the difference between 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound? [These](http://www.turtlebeach.com/products/ps3-gaming-headsets/ear-force-dpx21.aspx) are $20 cheaper than the Tritton AX Pro and have 7.1 surround sound. Also, is there any major difference between a good stereo sound and a surround sound headset? Do you just hear the direction of footsteps a bit better, or is there extra sounds you hear as well in surround sound?
p2696
sI2
V7.1 just has two extra speakers, whether or not 2 extra speakers are better than just 5.1 is just preference to me. I'm happy enough with 5.1 but 7.1 is more and more is usually better. I have never used a 7.1 headset so I cannot say if they're good or not but at that price it's very tempting.\u000a\u000aWith stereo you'll just hear what's coming from each side. With surround sound you'll be able to pick up if the footsteps are coming from behind, above, from the side etc. 5.1 or 7.1 will completely change your gaming experience even in Single Player. Games like BFBC2 are amazing with surround sound. Many people complain that surround sound is an unfair advantage in online FPS games which it is. I would definitely suggest getting at least 5.1 if you're interested in great sound quality. 
p2697
sI3
VNow what about the Tritton 720s compared to the AX pros? They're both 5.1 surround sound, so I'm not sure what the difference is besides price. I appreciate all the help.
p2698
sI4
VThe AX Pros have better sound quality. You can search youtube for comparison videos. If any of the videos mention low voice chat with the mic all you need to do is go into settings on PS3 and put voice chat up to 3 or 4. At voice level 2 most people cannot hear me but I come through really well at 3. \u000a\u000aThe AX Pros have quite a few wires which might put people off them but they're easy to manage as the wire coming off the headset is really long and you cen keep the rest of the wires near the TV/PS3 out of the way.\u000a\u000aThe AX Pros have a seperate amp which all the wires connect to apart from the power line for the headset (there's one for the amp and headset but both come from one plug). You can control all the speakers sound levels with the little controller connected to the headset wire. Most people put the rear speakers up louder than the rest as it makes footsteps much clearer to hear. The mic is easy to remove from the headset. The amp even has a triple jack output for speakers. It also has a connection for a second headset.\u000a\u000aYou should spend a couple hours searching youtube for videos on headsets such as - Turtle Beach, Tritton and Logitech. Those videos should give you much more experienced opinions by various people.

VI recently picked up mtgo in order to improve my drafting skills. I Want to play on paper with people, so for now the goal is strictly training. \u000a\u000aHowever, I've noticed that mtgo lets you see exactly what cards you picked; you can sort them etc. While in paper drafting, cards are face down. \u000a\u000a\u000aToday on mtgo I caught myself counting how many creatures I have so my picks would fill the curve. I've changed secondary color after noticing my initial secondary is not gaining momentum, two things I would've not see soon enough in paper. \u000a\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, if I choose to not look at my picks, I will have a serious disadvantage and will probably lose every game, thus learning nothing about my picks. \u000a\u000a\u000aIn short,  it feels to me that if I practice mostly on mtgo I will degrade my ability of holding a mental model of my picks. \u000a\u000a\u000aAm I overreacting? How should I train if I want to be good in paper draft? Are there other pitfalls to mtgo that I'm overlooking and should be aware of?

"Sorry" here is understood to mean "I'm sorry." That's an example of [ellipsis](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ellipsis). It's true that critical grammatical components are unstated, but they are understood. I think that's enough to emancipate "Sorry."

VI am trying to warp "Love me like you do" by Ellie Goulding and I am just having a really hard time getting it right. Most of the tutorials I have seen teach warping with an easy 4 on the floor beat, but how can I easily warp a track with a lead in and no typical house beats? \u000a\u000aThanks!
p2753

sI2
VI 100% am not following what the question is.\u000a
p2755
sI3
VIf you just find the original tempo of the track and click "warp straight", it's going to assume the entire vocal follows e.g. 128 bpm on the dot. What if this assumption isn't true? Unless it's a DIY acapella made with phase cancellation, chances are the artist warped the vocal themselves to fit the timing of the track a bit better. Since this is likely the case, how do you know having Ableton do it for you will come even close to correct? You can't know that a vocal is even close to on time just by assumption.
p2756
sI4
VI'm running with the assumption that we're talking about an original track where the artist commissioned the vocalist for the vocal performance. In situations like this, most of the time, the vocal won't need to be warped because it's already in time. So, in theory, the acapella WILL be the same tempo as the track, and it WILL follow the tempo for the entire track.\u000a\u000aBut, for the sake of argument, even if the original artist did warp the vocal, after they bounce it it'll be at the tempo they warped it at, so once again, determining the original BPM of the track will, in theory, give you the acapellas tempo.\u000a\u000aI've warped an absolute fuckton of music in Ableton, and this almost always holds true, except for in situations with older tracks. (A great example is Fast Car by Tracy Chapman. I don't know how the hell to warp that one. Any ideas?)

V*Using a throwaway just in case he frequents reddit.* \u000a\u000a\u000aApologies for the mistakes I (may) make in this post as English is my 2nd language. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAs stated in the title, I am a 21yo female who is currently working. I met him in the same company when I was an intern last year. (Both of us are no longer working there.) We actually lost touch with each other until this year. I am mainly to be blamed since I was undergoing a bad period of depressed emotions during the time(s) he tried to chat with me over the entire last year & I was being pretty distant towards everyone in general. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSome background about his/my personality (mindsets etc):\u000aHim: He is usually likable by everyone, has a vastly huge social circle (including loads of female/male close friends), is really optimistic, sensitive and caring towards people in general and he has a really good temper. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMe: Mainly easygoing yet likes to spend alone time, has a close-to-none social circle (Only a few friends as of now) due to a huge fallout last year, tend to overthink stuff a little too much due to my sensitive emotional nature and tend to keep things to myself until I end up "exploding".\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWe actually met quite frequently ever since the start of this year (usually once a week on weekends) and we are getting pretty close with each other. (There are actually mutual feelings on both sides) I am worried that since I am not as mature as him (be it in terms of goals/thoughts etc), it will end up dragging him down in the long run. Just to clarify that he has never been in a relationship, I used to have numerous relationships. Both of us are actually looking to settle down and we do have quite a lot of common interests. I believe we are currently at the "friends" stage at the moment. For some reason I actually felt slightly insecure whenever he is chatting with a few of his female friends, even though he is really open with his phone & actually asked a few times if I want to hang out with him and his friends. (I never revealed this to him since I don't wish to scare him off.)   \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWill age difference usually be a problem in relationships? And any advice/tips? How "fast" is too "fast" to be exclusive with each other? How do I get over its weird "insecurity" of mine since it will be a double standard as most of my friends are guys? \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWe are actually planning to spend Valentine's day together so do you think if a movie followed by a walk along the beach/park is a feasible idea? Both of us wish to take things slow since we are still virgins, and this is the first time I feel strangely comfortable and happy with someone whenever I see them (it makes me feel really shy for some reason whenever I see him). \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAny advice/insight will be greatly appreciated! \u000a\u000a   \u000a\u000a\u000a**tl;dr**: Mutual feelings on both sides, worried about the age difference and also insecurity on my own side. Hung out pretty often once per week, planning to spend Valentines' together this month as well so any advice will be great to hear.

VThank you for the response! It is really great to hear that it doesn't seem like an overly huge age difference for some people. (My parents are pretty traditional though.) \u000a\u000aHe seems to be open to taking things to the next level as far as I can tell. I personally feel that I still got a long way to go in regards to maturity even though I have seen & experienced far too much as compared to those my age. I am open to suggestions though :) He did mention that he likes me just the way I am.. to me the way I am now doesn't seem enough for me at least. \u000a\u000aHe got pretty bad texting habits though and don't usually give lengthy responses so sometimes I feel slightly bad about messaging him. He is completely fine in person though! (just slightly awkward and seemed nervous?)
p2791
sI2
VIf he really does like you just the way you are, there's no reason to really worry I believe. It's common for guys to not have great texting habits, I'm not great at it but I've gotten better, my SO is a little lazy about it which is what to used to be but what ever.\u000a\u000aToo many people think about themselves and concern what others think of them, especially their BF or GF, and don't even listen to them when they say "I like you just the way you are." It bugs me sometimes, but you should be happy with yourself, and even the person that cares about you the most (besides family), says that you're perfect for them, just be happy with it. That's the thing though too many people try to change themselves too much to be with people they can't have or to make the people they already have, respect them more. It's 110% unhealthy, just be who you are.
p2792
sI3
VThat is according to him I guess (at least he won't ask me to change for the sake of changing) despite me having a lot of flaws which I am currently trying my best to work on.\u000a\u000aI see! So what matters the most is how he acts towards me/treats me in person right? :) (the messaging habits can leave that aside since I do know that he is a bad texter)\u000a\u000aI do accept myself for the way I am so I will only change for my own sake and not for anyone else's sake. Been there and did that (changing for an ex SO) which ended up with horrible results. 
p2793
sI4
VSome people are lazy texters, some arent. Can't help it much, besides the to do better. Or at least have more if a initiative for it. I'm glad you don't change yourself for someone else, but I'm really sorry to hear you learned the bad way :/

VI'm currently writing a story, and I want the character to be dropped off at a place. Though this place has to have a certain feel to it: very lonely, desolate, challenging to be in, but I also want it to have a self-reflection quality to it. I was thinking of a desert, but that got me thinking, what are some other geographic features' meaning in literature?
p2804
sI1
VI'm not the OP, but just wanted to say that this was a lovely and insightful post. I like your list of examples, as well as the Lion King scene. I loved the movie and saw the musical, too. I forget if the musical also used similar geographical symbolism for that scene. It's been awhile.\u000a\u000aIn the movie *Gravity* there is also a similar contrast, between lack of water (space) and water (Earth represented as a blue planet) and the ending really drives that point home (which I'll stay also vague about in order to avoid spoilers). The nothingness of space throughout the film, forces the main character to reflect on everything.\u000a\u000aI love Jack London, and the irony in his stories is that water is everywhere in the icy tundra of Alaska, but it's the form of water that determines whether it's a friend or foe. The snow and ice are threats, but change its form to an ice block shelter, or dig a man-sized hole in the snow, and it can provide warmth. Add some heat, and you can get water. If the ground is solid, snow is fluffy, it can allow fast travel, but if it's unstable, fragile and slippery, it can mean death.\u000a\u000aI think because desolate places can change it's state, perhaps just for a moment, like a desert enjoying a brief rainfall, or a blizzard giving way to clear blue skies, is a powerful narrative device for self-reflecting characters. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p2805
sI2
VJack London's works have fantastic examples of geographic symbolism! Good one.\u000a\u000aI've only read White Fang, but just from that I gathered that London likes to go in-depth about survival in the harsh wilderness. And then the transition to California happens, where everything is green, warm, and easy - really marks internal transformation from wilderness to domestication.\u000a\u000aDarn, now I need to reread it; or I guess I should pick up Call of the Wild eventually.\u000aThanks for the discussion!
p2806
sI3
VI definitely recommend *Call of the Wild*, too. Such a moving tale. It actually starts in California (Santa Clara Valley), as a family's pet dog, Buck gets stolen, and ends up as a sled dog in the harsh icy territories of Northern America, where his adventures soon start. \u000a\u000aApparently, sled dogs were in high demand during the Klondike Gold Rush of the late 1800s, so dogs were indeed really stolen from all across the country.\u000a
p2807
sI4
VHaha oh so it's White Fang in reverse
p2808
sI5
VYeah, it is. :) I was curious and just checked now to see which was written first. It looks like *White Fang* came out in 1906, three years after *Call of the Wild* so I'm guessing the popularity of *Call of the Wild* prompted him to write the reverse story. Interesting, I had never really thought of that before.

VHello! I'm born in raised in New England, currently wrapping up college in western NY. I've been to Alaska before on one of those cruise things 8 years ago and fell in love with the state. I'm currently looking for jobs and for the hell of it applied to some in Anchorage. \u000a\u000aNow I'm looking at a decent chance of being hired long-term to work at a company here. What should I know before I move here? Besides the fact that I'll have to move via flying. What's the internet speed/mobile coverage like? How good is the public transportation in the city? (I don't have a license, but I know that's not the end of the world in Alaska). Has the food price situation gotten better since I visited? \u000a\u000aAlso how awesome is the zoo?\u000a\u000aI'll probably have more questions as you guys answer.

VSo was seeing a girl, for about 6 months now, things have been going well up until Friday night.  She revises her Instagram profile and puts a Kik Messenger username in there.  Right away, I can sense something isn't right as we had a disagreement about some stuff the day before.  Friday night she comes over and I notice she wont open up the Kik messenger notifications around me. She goes to the bathroom and I open up her phone to find that she has sent pics to other guys of her hand covering her boobs, I feel like I've been stabbed in the back, but I'm unsure of what is going on and decide to leave it, and its Thanksgiving so I decided to put it behind us for the time being and not ruin thanksgiving.\u000a\u000aI confront her about it last night, and she was upset when I told her I went through her phone but I didn't even stop to give any merit to her comment.  I told her that I was finished with this relationship and that I can't do this if she is going to cheat on me. \u000a\u000aHer only excuse was "Sometimes I sabotage myself" and then there was a lot of silence, and eventually a very weak "if it matters, I'm very sorry"\u000a\u000aOver the weekend, she had been talking about us eventually moving in together, taking trips together, and doing stuff that people in relationships would do.  I thought I was kinda walking the right line between not being super beta in the relationship, but I felt so side swiped by her double talk, wanting to be with me, but then still wanting to send pics to someone else\u000a\u000aHow do you deal with women having so much instant validation from other men, and just always having a queue of men line up ready to fuck them the minute you screw up and leave the picture?  Even just the random guys who will take a chance and throw a line out there, the women just soak up all this attention and then seem to start to get bored with the perceived "lack and quantity of validation" from me, how does a guy deal with it?\u000a\u000aThis is not very well written today, I haven't had much sleep lately.\u000a\u000aedit: I broke up with her last night after confronting her about the messages I saw\u000a\u000a\u000a

I have a feeling that she was one of the types that self-sabotages relationships like this when things get to comfortable or involved and wanted some breathing room.  \u000a\u000aIts just frustrating how you can invest so much time and effort into a relationship it all goes out the window because she can't be faithful.

VThere's a difference in wording between Frozen Heart/Randuin's Omen and Wither. Frozen Heart and Randuin's Omen **reduce** the target's attack speed, while Wither **slows** the target's attack speed.\u000a\u000aYasuo's Q cooldown is based on the amount of bonus attack speed he possesses. So my guess is that because Wither only slows his attack speed (but does not actually affect the stats he possesses), it does not affect the cooldown of his Q.

VThey both allow sub based games, the issue is that console users would pay that sub along with the general console sub (Xbox Live Gold or PS Plus). \u000a\u000aCombined with the fact that console players are generally put off by game specific subs and are largely an untapped market for MMOs, Zenimax made the decision to drop it.

Vhttp://i.imgur.com/yxe4Oas.jpg\u000a\u000aI made a diagram of my set up and proposed additions. I currently have the Schiit DAC and amp for my headphones and run the Preamp outs to the Emotiva Monitors with RCA. \u000a\u000aThere are two types of inputs on the back of the Emotivas, RCA and XLR. \u000a\u000aWhat I wanted to do was add a USB Audio Interface (particularly the Focusrite Scarlett 2i4) as I plan to start music production as a hobby and have read around as to how it's all set up. My concern was how I can switch between the DAC/ Amp and the Audio Interface. I was reading that it's a bad idea to have two inputs into speakers at the same time (RCA and XLR in this case).\u000a\u000aI don't know if I did the cable routing correctly but was wondering if there is an easier way to consolidate the cables and routing to the monitors. I don't know if you can plug say the pre-amp outs of the amp into the RCA Ins on the Mixer and then just have XLR out of the Mixer going to the monitors.\u000a\u000aAny clarification or information is greatly appreciated, thanks!\u000a
p2856
sI1
VYeah, that's essentially what I want to do but I was wondering if I'd lose the nice DAC on the Modi 2 Uber if I had my monitors running out of the audio interface. I know the preamp on the Magni 2 Uber is sort of a bonus. I don't know if the Scarlett 2i4 has the same quality of DAC as the Modi 2 Uber. \u000a\u000aI was thinking of using my Schiit stack for music listening exclusively with my headphones and using my ATH-M50's as studio monitoring headphones out of either the mixer or the audio interface but I imagine if audio is going out from the interface to the mixer, then everything can be done from the mixer panel. It definitely would simplify things if I used my monitors exclusively with the audio interface/ mixer and not the Schiit stack.
p2857
sI2
VI also have the Audio Technica ATH-M50x headphones and honestly 90% of the time I can not tell the difference between the 6i6 and the Magni 2 Uber. That last 10% of the time the Magni is slightly better.
p2858
sI3
VInteresting. So, as far as the speakers are concerned, there isn't a discernible difference between the Schiit stack and the audio interface? I was mainly concerned with that actually as I'd be a little sad if I gave up the quality of the Schiit stack sending the signal to the speakers and lost it when I switched over to the audio interface. But yeah, as far as headphones go, I'd be powering them with the Magni 2 Uber, I use Philips Fidelo X2's as my music listening headphones mainly and the ATH-M50's will be probably more appropriate for monitoring on the interface or mixer.
p2859
sI4
VI do not know about the speakers as I have never hooked up my Schiit stack to my speakers because I wanted TRS/XLR for a balanced connection. But headphones wise you will not loose any quality between the two.
p2860

VThanks for all the help! I think that is what I will do is simply use the interface/ mixer for the speakers and the Schiit stack for my X2's and other music listening headphones.

VI'm playing a stealth character who occasionally fights outside of stealth. Standing up from a crouch while moving has been making me sheathe my weapons/spells; which has gotten me killed several times due to the time lost in a) realizing that my spell isn't working (am I out of mana, no; am I paralyzed, no; controller still on, yes; oh, shit this asshole sheathed his shit; *run backwards in a panic while waiting for the unsheathe animation to finish*; cornered; *whack*, *whack*, *whack*, also *WHAM*, *dies*).\u000a\u000aSo what gives? Is this a known bug? Are characters *supposed to* put their weapons away when transitioning to and from stealth? Do I need to look into whether my controller is starting to shit the bed? Am I the only one this is happening to? \u000a\u000aAlso... pushing things other than Circle leading to the character menu opening? \u000a\u000a*EDIT: It's gotta be my controller.

VJust by sight. I have a Xbox360...the "bumpers" gave me some issues when I was pushing buttons. Test your controller by equipping your weapon and going in-and-out of stealth 10 or so times...it should be clear whether or not it is a controller issue.
p2866
sI3
VI tested this several times. When I'm stationary, it works fine. The problem arises when I am moving backwards or forwards using the left analog stick and push it then... the character menu comes up and upon pressing Circle to cancel out of it my character either Sheathes his weapons (normally Square) or jumps (normally Triangle).

(THE FOOD WAS WORTH IT)  I was wondering if it's realistic to lose this weight I've put on in a similar time frame? It seems like I've put it on faster than I've lost it (I previously weighed about 62kg and even with healthy eating and exercising it seemed to take me a while to get down to 56kg)  Anyone have any experience with losing weight they put back on, and if it is as quick of a process as putting it on?

VHello r/pf, I'm in a bit of a pickle right now. I want to get rid of my 06 Ford Escape, which I have already come to a deal with a man to sell for $9,800. I have found a 2011 Chevy Malibu for $11,650. The main reason I wanted to get a new car was for the gas mileage as well as knock my car insurance payments down a bit. \u000a\u000aHowever, I was only approved for a $1,000 personal loan from a credit union only because my step-dad is co-signing. That is not enough to cover the cost of the car along with the taxes I will have to pay for the registration and plates. Total cost will be approx. $12500. I currently make about $10,000 a year working part-time while I go to school.\u000a\u000aI have just applied for a $7,500 car-loan (the minimum) from my bank (CHASE). Basically, I wanted the opinions of you guys as to whether I'm going about this right. Do you think my loan will be approved? My Step-dad has excellent credit and his APR is usually about 1.9% on loans just for him, but he also has a mortgage out, his car loan in his name, and my mom's car loan in his name as well. What do you think my APR would be for my loan? \u000a\u000aWhat I plan to do is right away give $4,800-$5,000 back, then make monthly payments. My dad (not step-dad who will co-sign) says he will be giving me $100/month for it, but his employment is never steady and I don't want to depend on his unreliable income. I can also use my tax refund to pay off roughly $500, maybe more. \u000a\u000aAs of now my current monthly expenses are as follows:\u000a\u000a* Phone bill:  $80\u000a* Car Insurance:  $128\u000a* Fuel: approx. $160\u000a\u000aI make about anywhere from $160-$220/week, usually about $180, totaling about $720/month after taxes. Am I going about this correctly? I also just opened up an account with Discover which has given me a $500 line of credit. It sucks having no credit. \u000a\u000aAny advice, guys?
p2909
sI1
VWell, technically I'm only spending 1850 (plus taxes) on a new car since I'm selling my old car for 9800. I asked chase for the car loan because they are my bank and I thought I had a better chance of getting approved through them. Is it likely that I get approved for a car loan at the credit union?\u000a
p2910
sI2
VNo, you shouldn't be thinking of it as spending $2k on a new car. *Technically* you're selling one (depreciating) asset for $9800, then purchasing another (depreciating) asset for $12k. You're still handing over $12k for the privilege of driving a mediocre Chevy sedan. If you don't have a few thousand dollars hand for unforeseen expenses like this maybe you should try to save some money for emergencies.\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you're really set on getting rid of the Escape you can easily get into another car for *less* money. A car that will have just as much *utility* as the Malibu. Something a little bit older might also run you less in auto insurance too.\u000a\u000aI'd ask the credit union anyway, they offer really good rates on car loans for members. Hell, I'd ask about shifting my regular banking over to them too. When I joined mine it was with the express purpose of getting a car loan, told them that, opened the checking/savings account, applied for the loan, banga-bing-bada-boom done. Also had sure convenient automatic transfers to pay the loan.
p2911
sI3
VI do have a little over $1500 in my checking account for things such as emergencies and what not... I should have mentioned that in the OP. \u000a\u000aI see what you are saying with the car situation, and how they are depreciating assets. However, I am looking at this from the perspective of my future and I believe this car will last until I graduate with my masters degree, which is in about 5 years. It has only 40k miles on it and I am getting it for about $2000 less than it is worth. I appreciate the feedback though, and I welcome more, but first I'd like you to consider the future for myself and my "mediocre" sedan. 
p2912
sI4
VA good make/model 2006 will easily last you another 5-8 years, well through your masters degree. (I'm thinking Honda/Toyota, but I hear good things about Ford/Mazda/Hyundai from those years too.) I'd heavily discount the "$2000 less than it's worth" argument. Do you think you could flip it immediately for $2000k more than you pay for it? Probably not.\u000a\u000aThing is, a car is just a tool. It's not *really* an asset. Does it get you to work and to class? Is it reasonably safe? If it does those things then it really doesn't matter what the "book value" is on the car. There are a few things to be said for the gas mileage and the 'fun factor' in your personal valuation of the vehicle's worth, but those don't always side with "buy newer".\u000a\u000aWith money tight and a good bit more school ahead of you, the money you sink into that nearly new car may be better off spent elsewhere. When you get a masters level job with a nice salary there will be plenty of time and money for new cars.
p2913
sI5
VAgree with above poster.  I have a 2006 Honda Civic with 100k miles and that thing is still running as well as it did when I first got it... have had to replace some things beyond normal maintenance (sunroof died, CD player had to be replaced), but other than that it's got a spotless mechanical record.  A used Honda Civic 06 can be had for well under $9,800.  Use this as an opportunity to swap out vehicles and walk away with cash in hand.  I certainly wouldn't be leveraging yourself further while you're still going to school at the very least.  From an outside perspective, the route you're heading just increases your risk.

VPeople are focusing on hand gestures and voice commands. That's great, I agree. \u000a\u000aBut what about the classical input devices like keyboard, mouse, joystick, gamepad, steering wheel and the list goes on.\u000a\u000aWhat about a classical text editor like Word or code editor like Sublime or even something like Scrivener?\u000a\u000aWhat about games controlled by your keyboard and mouse or any other device e.g. gamepad or some dedicated HoloLens peripherals?\u000a\u000aI would use HoloLens for writing using a regular keyboard (or the new [Microsoft Universal Foldable Keyboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpnQjwto2p8)?) or some chorded keyset. It could be useful in shared environments, where privacy is a must. Imagine that you are sitting by a campfire at night while typing your next horror/romantic/whatever-fiction story wearing just your HoloLens and holding Twiddler in your hand.\u000a\u000aTo sum it up, I think HoloLens will become very popular among writers including creative writers typing their stories using the classical keyboard or some other device like chorded keyboard i.e. Twiddler (Check [this video how it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG3SPSzWUv4)) or some other peripheral for HoloLens that will emerge in the near future.\u000a\u000a**UPDATE:**\u000aTrewgrip should be compatile with HoloLens, according to their response to my email: \u000a\u000a"We haven\u2019t tested TREWGrip with HoloLens (or Windows 10), but TREWGrip uses a standard keyboard/mouse descriptor so it should be compatible out of the box."\u000a

VThe FOV will be probably bigger. The previous version presented in January had bigger FOV than this one presented on BUILD. But even if that's not the case, the next generations will have much bigger FOV, as you have said.
p2925
sI2
VEven if FOV would be increased, the question of resolution still remains open. I honestly doubt that Hololens has more than FullHD resolution, which translates into only one virtual screen. So, moving one's head can be the only solution here, with many virtual screen anchored in different places, but only displaying the one you are directly looking at.\u000a\u000aEDIT: typos
p2926
sI3
VUpvoting you for contributing to the discussion, but you don't need an HD display for a text editor. Super high pixel density screens need to magnify text considerably for it to be legible at all. If an HMD had an HD resolution spread over a large FOV, it could emulate more than one readable standard-sized display.\u000a\u000aFOV limitations would still limit the number of virtual monitors you could see simultaneously, but without using the device in that context it's hard to know how much of a problem that will be. My intuition is that the benefit of having infinite monitors would be worth having to move your head to see some of them, but if I already had a 3 or 4 monitor setup I might think otherwise.
p2927
sI4
VI agree with you about "readable" part. However, 21"-23" inch FullHD monitors are pretty much standard nowadays, and at least for me text with 960x540 resolution on 21" screen looks like (albeit readable) shit. (The screen have native resolution of 1920x1080, so that's not the issue with scaling per se).

VI've seen multiple people with dogs that do this. How does it work? How are they trained?\u000a\u000aEDIT: I meant blood sugar, sorry. Thanks guys!
p2990
sI1
VMost often those VOCs are ketones, which smell pretty bad (and strong). I used to work with a guy whose blood sugar was difficult to regulate, and he specifically asked me to warn him if I smelled his breath, because that was a warning that his blood sugar was getting low. And when it was really low, he would fly off the f*cking handle at just about anything--like crazy screaming and stuff. I warned him several times over the course of a year, and even managed to talk him down from a crazy rant by pointing out his breath odor.\u000a\u000aTL;DR: I was a diabetes sniffing dog for a while.
p2991
sI2
VKetones are in high concentration when blood sugar is high. You wouldn't be smelling Ketones from low blood sugar. 
p2992
sI3
VKetones are produced when your body uses fat for energy. There are a few reasons this may happen, 1) you do not have enough glucose in your bloodstream 2) you do not have enough insulin in your blood to process the glucose you do have to provide the energy your body needs. So while technically keytones on your breath could signify any level of blood sugar, it typically means you do not have enough.\u000a
p2993
sI4
VWhy were my ketone tests administered exclusively when my blood sugar was very high? Why does ketoacidosis occur when blood sugar levels are extremely high, but not extremely low? Thanks for the input. \u000a\u000aGenerally, low sugar episodes don't  occur for long enough to cause the body to rely on fat in the absence of glucose so that ketones accumulate to significant levels.

VHey everyone, I\u2019m in a bad place and I need some advice.  My GF of 11 years and I recently broke up after a long chain of events, and are still living together in different bedrooms in our apartment, and I need real help and advice to move forward.  Its not that I want you all to do the heavy lifting, but I need some help in direction.\u000a	\u000aBackstory: we are in our early 30\u2019s, and have been together for 11 years.  Our relationship has always been unique and special in the way that I am an extrovert, and she is introvert.  Before we got together, I was in a couple of 1 to 2 year relationships, whereas she had only a couple of very short ones.  We fell deeply in love, and quickly started living together.  Our physical attraction to each other was intense at first, and we made love constantly.  Our level of trust with each other grew and we became a cohesive unit, we became everything to each other.  We had a large group of friends, 98% hers from college, who we socialized frequently with.\u000a	\u000aLike all relationships, our honeymoon phase ended, with our level of physical intimacy declining over time.  This mostly started due to a quick phase of physical issues with me, as I am a type I diabetic and was in poor control of my health in my early 20\u2019s.  My GF was amazing, and insisted that I take better care of myself, as she would not spend her life with someone who would not.  I got better, but the scars of my own insecurities remained, and I had issues with initiating sex, as I was scared she would reject me.  This pattern of behavior has plagued our relationship ever since, but as she has explained to me now; she was willing to make the compromise to be in sometimes-sexless relationship, as she loved me.  \u000a	\u000aOur relationship operated under that guise for a long time.  Major life events happened, I lost my mother to cancer, a time where my GF was there for me every day.  We moved to a different part of the country for two reasons, her family lived there and my career was not going well and a transfer within the same company was a chance to stay afloat.  After moving, I sought out therapy as I had completely stopped feeling emotions or discussing them with her.  Once again, this was a change that she had to push me into. Not because she is bossy and pushy, but because I am always unwilling to make the necessary changes in my life.  It was helpful, but temporary, and I quickly moved on. Things were better, but not fixed. \u000a        \u000aI knew I needed a life change, but was weak and lazy in picking a new direction. It took my GF basically picking a new life path for me, to go back to school and get a degree in the medical field.  Once again, she did this not as a nag, but because I was floundering and needed direction.  This is the pattern.  I am faced with a situation that requires me to take action, and I fail every time because I just say, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, BUT I REALLY want to change!\u201d  It leads to failure every time.\u000a        \u000aThat\u2019s a lot of backstory, but necessary.  Once we made the last move, I started riding my bike everywhere and taking the train/walking.  I\u2019ve always been overweight, but generally healthy (good BP,HR, Cholesterol, A1C glucose) and I began to loose weight.  At around the same time is where the real issues started that has left me where I am today.  I began to seek out attention from a younger group subset of our long time group of friends.  I crafted this persona, and really dove into it with gusto, of being a young party person, who wanted to stay up all night drinking, texting and chatting constantly with a few people who were much younger than me.  I know that Age Aint Nuthin But A Number, but it was a lot of energy to focus on a group of people who\u2019s biggest priority is getting fucked up all night and not working.  \u000a        \u000aMy GF was cool with it, she gave me my space and trusted in our relationship.  She explained that she wanted me to be able to have fun, and she didn\u2019t want to be a wet blanket.  Essentially, she made another in a long string of compromises to maintain our relationship.  Well, the attention I put on this group escalated and became focused on one person in particular, and became inappropriate.  My GF is a highly perceptive person, and was not oblivious to what was happening.  She spent a lot of time attempting to dialogue with me about what was happening, but I was unwilling and unable to articulate it, as per usual, I would state that I did not why I was acting that way.\u000a        \u000aIt came to the point where she was clear that I would need to take action to save our relationship.  She was done doing all the heavy lifting and it was time for me to do something.  I made promises, as I always had in the past, and made a minimal amount of effort, but in the end, did nothing.  I was away for most of April at training for a new job and through a series of phone conversations, where I was honest about everything that had happened, we broke up.  My attention on others and where I took that was bad, but what was worse, what really put us where we are, was my lack of action and the lack of care that shows her.  She wants to know why I so actively pursued the destruction of our relationship, with the belief that I must have wanted out, but was unwilling to do the work myself and attempted to force her to break up with me.\u000a        \u000aWe have to live together due to financials, but our lease is up in September.  We have agreed to work on our situation, and that it is possible to get back together, but she feels it is unlikely.  She feels this way as I have never successfully changed in the past and I have a lot of work to do to regain her trust and be a person she wants to be with.  While it would seem easier to just go our separate ways, we have loved each other for so long, and neither of us ever planned on being single again.  I want more than anything to work it out.  Not because it is comfortable, but because I truly love her, and I feel such a weight in my heart over what I have done.  \u000a\u000aSo, here we are.  That was a long story, but here is where I need some help:  \u000a\u000a1.	I\u2019m scared that my inability to think about my issues and take action will result in the same level of failure as in the past.  I am seeing a therapist, who I do not like and will be switching this week, I am reading r/relationship_advice looking for suggestions, and the two of us talk a few nights a week.\u000a2.	I\u2019m thinking about my issues on a higher level, well I am trying too, than ever before, and I began journaling my thoughts.  I did this because in the past I would never keep track of my emotions or thoughts.\u000a3.	I need help proving to her that I am the type of person she can trust and would want to be with.  I\u2019ve already made some mistakes in regards to this, as I had a drink with a woman who I met a year ago at a wedding, who is similar in character to the person I focused all the attention on mentioned above.  I put myself in that situation, as I wanted to see how I would handle it, whether I would act as I had before or if I could be mature about it.  I was mature, and spent the entire time talking about my GF.  When my GF asked me who I had been interacting with, I told her, and she was hurt.  She asked me to empathize and look at the situation from her point of view, and I could instantly see that I fucked up.     \u000a4.	I also stopped drinking, pretty much completely.  For a long time I had started drinking a lot during the week, sitting on the couch with my GF.  When the recent issues started, I knew that my drinking was part of what caused my behavior, but only a part.  I decided to stop for the time being to help me get my head straight.\u000a\u000aThank you for taking the time to read all of this, and please offer any suggestions you might have.      \u000a

VI agree that she doesn't deserve this, and that is why we are trying to work it out.

VI was about to go to Buenos Aires today, but the lady at the check in desk denied me because my passport is a little worn and beat up. I thought it just looked kinda cool that way, but apparently they're very picky about the state of the passport. I was able to get a refund for my flight, and now I'm trying to figure out what to do next...\u000aI was going to Buenos Aires with my buddy, and now he's on his way solo. He's never been there, and he can't speak much Spanish, so I'm trying to get down there ASAP.\u000a\u000aThe people at the Airport said I can go to the passport agency and get a duplicate made by tomorrow afternoon. With that knowledge I booked the cheapest flight leaving Tuesday, but I'm worried they gave me shitty information, and it'll at least take a couple days to get a duplicate passport. Do any of you have any experience getting a duplicate passport? I have an appointment schedule at the passport agency and I'm hoping for the best. Also, I have 24 hrs to cancel the flight, so if I'm not able to get a passport by then, I'll be okay. \u000a\u000aAlso, I was thinking about just printing my ticket at home to avoid the check in desk people, then take my chances with TSA. I read some articles that the passport should be okay as long as the laminated page is good condition and you can make out the passport# (which you can with mine). This is a last resort plan, but it seems like the bullshit desk ladies are way more picky than they really have to be. I've crossed borders with this passport in the same condition and had no issues. It's just a little beat up, and the last page is coming off slightly in one corner.  \u000a\u000aPretty shitty situation... We were also psyched to leave, and now I'm stuck back home with my buddy on his way. I would really appreciate any advice. Thank you \u000a

They may look at it and say "What??? Why didn't they let you on the flight that's CRAZY" and then maybe you go back and just don't have the person at the check in counter examine it this time. And if they do think you need a new passport, well, you're right there and they can get you a new passport tout suite.\u000a\u000aI'd plan to get there right when they open. Not sure about Minneapolis but I used to see people lined up around the block at the New York City equivalent of this spot.

VThank you Sara. I'll be there bright and early. I'm really hoping the people at the airport were right and I can get this duplicate tomorrow. Also, maybe you'd know this... I paid the reciprocity fee for Argentina a few years ago, and it's valid for 10 yrs. But will the reciprocity fee that I already paid still work if I get a new passport?  \u000aEDIT: Never mind, i found out how to retrieve it 
p3007

VUsually, you get your old passport back with a hole punched in it, and you can present it together with your new one to prove you've obtained a visa.  But each country differs and I'm not familiar with Argentina specifically.

VYeah, for some reason they didn't give me my old passport back, but I was able to get a photo copy of my passport and the visa stamp. I'm really conflicted now...

VWagthen is one of three direct daughter languages from Thengan, using a Hindi-inspired alphabet. The syllables are in (C)V(C) format, much like Thengan itself. The words use a sort of root system, inspired by a different language I saw here.\u000a\u000aThe roots are usually two to four consonants. The vowels in between them determine what kind of word they are.\u000a\u000aLet's take f-n-\u03b8, the root for "language." The first vowel, between f and n, determines the type of word it is.\u000a\u000a/a/- noun, pronoun\u000a\u000a/e/- verb\u000a\u000a/i/- adjective, adverb (There is no difference between these two in Wagthen; instead of saying "I run quickly," you would say "I run fast."\u000a\u000a/o/- preposition, conjunction (There are very few conjunctions in Wagthen, so it is not worth it to waste a vowel spot on them.)\u000a\u000aThe second vowel, between n and \u03b8, determines the gender. (Of course, only nouns have genders in Wagthen, so in other words, this vowel adds detail.) Some words are genderless, meaning they can be used with any of the three genders: animate, inanimate, and abstract. Some examples are occupations, school subjects,and names of languages. In this case, no letter is put in between these letters.\u000a\u000a/a/- animate\u000a\u000a/e/- inanimate\u000a\u000a/i/- abstract\u000a\u000aAnd finally, the third vowel, after \u03b8, adds detail. Sometimes, a vowel before f is also inserted to add detail.\u000a\u000aLet's make some examples using the root for "steal" r-t-d.\u000a\u000aratde- thief\u000a\u000aratada- the act of stealing\u000a\u000arateda- an object stolen from one\u000a\u000aretada- to steal\u000a\u000aratda- a very low price. (One of these things is not like the others.)\u000a\u000aAnd some more using the aforementioned root, f-n-\u03b8.\u000a\u000afan\u03b8a-language\u000a\u000afena\u03b8a- to speak\u000a\u000afan\u03b8i- a language that one does not know\u000a\u000aAny ideas to improve upon this?
p3019
sI1
VThe biliteral roots are mainly used for tense words- words that denote the tense of a verb, or whether a noun is plural- so they aren't really needed.\u000a\u000aFor quadriliteral roots, the fourth space acts as an extra "detail" space.
p3020
sI2
VHmm... a whole root for marking plural? I'm curious how that is suppose to look.\u000a\u000aAlso, what is the vowel system like? You make it look like you only have "a", "e", "i", and a conditional "o", which is... strange. What sounds do they represent?
p3021
sI3
V/a/, /e/, /i/, and /o/, of course. Wagthen also has /u/, /y/, and /\u026a/.\u000a\u000aAs for the plurals...\u000a\u000aThe word "ratde" means "thief", but that is only singular. In Wagthen, to make it plural, you would add the syllable "san" in front of it. So the word for "thieves" is "sanratde." This also applies to pronouns- "akala" is "I," while "sanakala" is "we." Quite a mouthful, isn't it?
p3022
sI4
VI'm guessing /u/, /y/, and /\u026a/ are only used in those "detail positions"?\u000a\u000aI don't think long pronouns are especially strange, especially if the language is pro-dropping. If not, or even if so, I think it would eventually shorten... maybe to **akla** or **kala**, since marking "I" as animate is a little pointless?\u000a\u000aAnother question: What of case? Marked by detail or more biliterals? Or maybe just strict word order?
p3023
sI5
VYeah, I meant **akla**. I don't know what I meant with **akala**.\u000a\u000aCase will probably be marked by a biliteral after the word. So **akla[biliteral]** would probably be the word for "me."

VI have noticed in several ground 'after' pictures of the Jarrell TX May 27 - 1997 there are these odd round circles on the ground. I am familiar with cycloidal arcing, drag marks, etc. but don't recall seeing these before in tornado damage images until Jarrell. \u000a\u000ahttps://extremeplanet.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/jt-dc-1.png\u000a\u000aIs it possible, since Jarrell was a multi-vortex, that these are touchdown 'suction' marks from small vortices within the larger body? They seem very tightly clustered. I just can't figure out what else they could be.
p3027
sI1
VYes, apparently it was at 2mph when it hit Double Creek. I was thinking that possibly those divots were from surface removal - apparently they also had to remove top layers for recovery purposes in some areas. The clearly circular patterns, though, seem odd for this.\u000a\u000aAlso, the [gravity wave effect study](http://homepages.vvm.com/%7Ecurtis/Jarrell/Jarrell.htm) is fascinating in regards to 'backward motion' and the low shear, high CAPE of that day. I had just posted a story on /r/StormComing on this http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/36azjw/the_incredible_jarrell_tx_tornado_probably_one_of/\u000a\u000a 
p3028
sI2
VGood links, and thanks for the new sub - I hadn't seen that before.\u000a\u000aI'd love to see more in depth the supposed reasons for the relative storm motion on this day - because there doesn't appear to be a synoptic reason for the SW tracking - other than that the angle of the initial boundary is in that direction.
p3029
sI3
VOf course you know that a tornado can double back when its bottom is hit by outflow winds from a thunderstorm's core. In this case I believe it had to do with the massive gravity wave to the south east -that generated a strong pocket of localized shear as well. \u000a\u000aIf I seem wrong on any of this, please correct me. I am always learning.
p3030

VThe Jarell, TX tornadoe is one of the first tornadic storms linked to gravity waves.  Some other recent tonadoes linked to gravity waves is the  joplin tornadoe and may 19, 2013 tornadoes east of oklahoma city, and maybe even the may 20, 2013 moore, ok tornado.  Gravity waves are kind of a chuppacabra of meteorology, and their affects on storms are unknown.  I have seen them created from "heat bursts" from thunderstorms.  Their effects seem to last hours to days long.   They seem to amp up any storms which may form near them, but are not needed to create violent tornadoes.
p3031
sI5
VI like how you put that; 'chupacabra'. \u000a\u000aIt was while studying the Jarrell that I first discovered Gravity Waves in relation to amping up storms. I have a fascination with resonant waves and effects so it is very interesting.\u000a\u000aI had heard of Jarrell, but had not really studied it until during the 2011 outbreak one of the tornados took a 'backward' track and I went into research mode. I cannot recall which tornado that was now. \u000a\u000aThank you for your info. I did not know the other tornados you mentioned were also linked to gravity waves.

VYes it was cheaper when it launched. But the 780 TIs are being discontinued and are an excellent price in my opinion. How much better is the 980 to the 780 TI?
p3066
sI2
VMy sources say it's about 10% more powerful of a card, approximately, it runs cooler, and it has a lower power draw iirc. \u000a\u000aPlus if the 780s are being discontinued you won't be able to easily upgrade to an sli configuration later on

VFirst : Sorry for destiny mentions , and for any mistakes  and please bear with me here. \u000a\u000aAhoy guardians , cof cof (Sorry i still dont know the lingo for this game) . \u000a\u000aSo long story short . I loved destiny, but because of some health issues i was unable to enjoy the proper end game. (Bad memory , concentration issues along with with no willl power to talk to strangers to go raiding or whatever needed matchmaking outside of the game , because i just didn´t feel good ... anoying people with my problems , keep forgetting mazes, terrible at jumping puzles so you can figure me problems raiding ...Vog took me a lot of time to learn , i could do all the fights by the end but the mazes always fucked me up, crota was easier i just followd people in the begining and the fight mecanics were easy after some readind( Thanks reddit !!)  Then TTK came , more complicated mecanics (for me) And i just didn´t wanna bother more people ...  (When i would try to find a fireteam i would previously explain my "problems" and naturaly nobody wanted to tag along with me (A couple of execptions though) As far as shooting stuff i am probably a casual/average player , and i do have the more kill´s in strikes a lot of times. \u000a\u000a\u000aSo this being said , i know there are some "similarities" between this games . And i have a few questions for you guys. \u000a\u000aWill i be able to play solo and progress trough the game end content ?  (By solo i dont mean COMPLETLY solo , i do enjoy the automatic anonymous matchmakin like in Destiny strikes , and even talking with people in my "best days" ) . \u000a\u000aThe game does provide matchmaking for all activities right  ? \u000a\u000aDO you guy s think the end game will mostly focus on Pvp aka Dark zones from what i understand ? (Not a big fan of pvp destiny/Cod style  ... concentration issues and bad memory = very hard to memorize maps , and looking at my silly dog instead of shooting sometimes ... \u000a\u000aI do enjoy the idea of farming for good stuff (if  i have de means to do it , i dont mind some grinding) \u000a\u000aI have so many questions be this ones are the most important . \u000a\u000aSome background to make you understand .\u000a\u000aI am somewhere in my 30´s , strugling with depression for 10+ years , and  i  also dont have a lot of money , (i can buy the game no problem , but it´s very expensive for me ) \u000a\u000aThis Being said , what do you think ? I would really love to play this , but dont wanna spend 70 euro on it and then dont play it because of my stupid brain ...\u000a\u000aThanks in advance . \u000a\u000aEDIT : Thanks guys , i feal a bit more "enlightened" and i will probably pick it up soon .\u000aWont be back on computer soon , but feel free to leave any sugestions , i will respond to all.

VThanks . \u000a\u000awow, that new Hard mode sistem looks funny . I will take my time, i am a real casual player (If i really like a game i will put maybe 10h/week top´s) \u000a\u000aMy thing is i do like to interact with players (OH i do miss the early dancing with everybody in vanilla destiny, but i am just not a big talker and although i understand english sometimes its a bit hard with all the people talking and using slang or some accent´s. Join the depression and you get me , a guy who enjoys playing with others , if i dont have to talk, wich was hard in destiny, but  i do talk and enjoy it on my "good" days . \u000a\u000aThanks :)

VThere are emotes that can be useful if a fellow agent is keen enough to notice.\u000a\u000aI'm much the same with "communication," haha. I don't really talk. \u000a\u000aMy advice? Be a support player and be defensive, don't go rushing in, let your other more communicative players be the aggressors. Build your tech to heal/revive and buff damage taken/given. I use the heal machine with auto revive along with a buff that boost damage defensive stats on cover, and as my "super" (you press "L1/R1" to activate) i have an insta heal that buffs all agents health briefly.\u000a\u000aNon communication hasn't been a hassle to me personally with this set up.

VI think i tried that healing in the betta , althoug i only played for 4 hours I can give it a try ... but i usually go for the thank build . Ex-titan here , hehe .\u000a\u000aThis match making sistem and you guuys coment´s are realy helping , more 70E to ubi i supose... :P\u000a\u000aCan we change build´s "easily" ? 
p3083

VYup, as long as it's "unlocked" you can use it and change your build on the fly. Though i wouldn't recommend it mid mission, the AI can get super aggressive if you are passive.

VOkay, 0x124 with 0x0, some value, 0x0, 0x0 means the CPU has detected a hardware problem. Almost always 0x0 in the last two parameters mean there is a PCIe bus communication problem, but I have to look at the mini dumps to be sure. To provide these, copy (not move) the folder c:\u005cwindows\u005cminidump to the desktop and zip it up. Upload the zip to a file sharing site like mega.co.nz, mediafire, dropbox, etc. and post the link here. I can then analyze the mini dump(s) with a debugger to read the exact error the CPU is reporting and look at a couple of important system parameters (BIOS version, BCLK, etc).

VIt's indeed crashing from a bus timeout, so there's a problem communicating with a PCIe device, probably the video card.\u000a\u000aFirst make sure the video card is properly inserted into its slot by taking it out and putting it back in. Unplug your PC first and be careful with the retention mechanism at the front of the slot.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately the SMBIOS block is not present in the mini dump, so we'll have to manually verify a couple of things. Run [CPU-Z](http://www.cpuid.com/downloads/cpu-z/cpu-z_1.72.1-en.zip) and make sure the "Bus Speed" is 200 MHz +/-1%. Switch to the mainboard tab and check the BIOS version and date, then go to the support site for your motherboard and check if you have the latest BIOS. If not, update it to the latest version using the BIOS build-in flash function (I recommend not using the Windows BIOS update software because Windows isn't perfectly stable on your system).\u000a\u000aIf all of that doesn't help, then I recommend testing your system with your old video card if possible. Probably the video card is defective.
p3098
sI5
V   Cpu bus speed is 200.85-200.88 MHZ\u000a\u000a   i do not recall having crashes of any kind with my other video card, so it may very well be a defective card. heres hoping that they hold up their warranty\u000a\u000a   the revsison version of my motherboard unfortunately only has one BIOS version, so cant update. \u000a\u000a   it is late here, and i intend to clean my pc tomorrow anyway, so i will report back on whether or not it is a seating issue tomorrow.\u000a\u000a  thank you very much for all the help.

VLet me start with there is a **TL;DR** at the bottom of this for you lazy readers and the fact that I have played FO4 for nearly 2,000 hours since release on a multitude of characters. That being said I think it's obvious I really enjoy playing, talking about, and watching the game but that doesn't mean I don't think it didn't fail to deliver some core game mechanics an open world, rpg is suppose to provide. I wanted to take the time to share my main problem with F04 besides the blatant dumbing down of dialog options/choices and general lack of abstract solutions to problems/quest stages that are S.P.E.C.I.A.L. related.\u000a\u000aI thoroughly enjoyed building my settlements up to be marvels of the Commonwealth wasteland but they are all completely filled up with bland, cookie-cutter "settlers". Let's face it, they are all dumb as a rock, whiny, steal your items/bed, and just a hassle to properly manage. I need to do so much for them and I honestly don't want to as I have no tangible investment in any of these "settlers". My desire to help any of these numb-nuts is below 0% at this point. \u000a\u000aEver since **Automatron** gave us the option of having robot workers/settlers many of us have completely erased our settlers from our bases. Why is that? Well for starters our robots are directly made by us. That's personal attachment and involvement right from the start. Then you add on the fact that they do not need to eat or sleep, will not constantly complain about the living conditions, and they even defend their settlements better. Why wouldn't you switch to robot civilians? They take less resources and management, get more work done without sleep, automatically look badass (and diverse), and finally each one has relevance to your personal SS- creating a natural bond much stronger than some random wanderer taking your amazing city for granted.\u000a\u000aWith **Wasteland Workshop** now giving us a few more things to do with our settlements like; have pets, stage battles in arenas, build more powered objects, and have more decorations the settlers have become even more bland! I don't want to share a drink or watch a cage fight between deathclaws with some stranger more or less mooching off me but rather a character from the story my SS has interacted with. I don't want to fill my contribution to the Commonwealth with soulless entities but rather the real, breathing people of the Commonwealth.\u000a\u000a**Followers** help balance against this horde of generic npcs but there are only 12 followers in the game! That's not nearly enough to fill a settlement up to have a follower city that could be filled with real friends. That's also not even close to enough trusted combatants to send to separate settlements, giving each settlement a "leader" or more like 2nd in command behind you. However what I'm asking for isn't more followers because not everyone is a fighter, hell some of the current followers seem unfit for battles the SS is destined to be a part of. I'm looking at you Piper, Curie, and sadly even you Dogmeat.  \u000a\u000aWhat I'm asking for is, npcs that have more depth to them so we can offer them a better life and become invested in them and our settlements! There are a number of unique npcs that the SS is able to convince to move to a settlement. The vault salesman, Tina De Luca (fix your fucking bugs Bethesda), Ann Codman, and Sheffield to name a few people that you can actually offer better lives too. Why wasn't this applied to so many more important, fun, or just plain memorable npcs?\u000a\u000a**WARNING THIS IS WHERE REAL SPOILERS EXIST**\u000a\u000a**Virgil** [the ex-institute, mutated scientist](/spoiler) is a perfect example of an npc that Bethesda simply didn't finish. Since he is a pretty important character I put spoiler tags here. There are so many different paths you can take in shaping Virgil's future; [you can use him and leave him to his fate to turn into a full fledged supermutant that's hostile on sight, you can promise to help him and return with the cure only to lie to him and convince him to kill himself/ have you kill him before he loses what ever is left of his humanity, or return with the serum and cure him. Later you can be ordered to kill him through the BoS which splits into; being able to betray Virgil- lie on his behalf- or even convince BoS he is no longer a threat as you have cured him. If you do decide to spare his life and cure him what do you get? Nothing but access to his stupid lab which you could have already stealthy looted anyways (his lab is trashed and ill equipped compared what you'd already be able to make yourself)! If you blow up the Institute a cured Virgil becomes upset and asks you to leave his cave in peace out of sorrow for humanities lose and his disapproval of your involvement but what happens if you become the director of the Institute? Absolutely nothing! WTF Bethesda, I've become the leader of the place Virgil left out of principle and I helped him become human again! He has no reason to live in this cave now, he should come back to the Institute to truly continue his research! He should at least be allowed to move to a settlement with the now lack of a threat from the Institute. He could reason, if I wanted him dead I could do it easily myself so why would I have a less equipped resource risk it's safety on attacking him? With me as the head of the Institute he literally has no benefit or reason to live in his cave anymore yet Bethesda condemned him to a life surrounded by a never ending radiation hell-storm!](/spoiler)\u000a\u000aThat was one of my favorite npcs so I went into depth there but the list goes on;\u000a\u000a1. **Nat Wright:** She lives alone in Diamond city for anyone that has recruited Piper and sent her to a settlement. Doesn't that sound kind of fucked up?\u000a2. **Initiate D. Clarke:** He can be convinced to turn himself in but upon springing him from the brig you can't offer him a home? One where he can continue his ghoul therapy theory?\u000a3. **Any of the survivors of the quest Cabot House:** With the Cabots' operation interrupted, don't you think they'd like a safe lifestyle or at least a new untainted homebase?\u000a4. **Tommy Logan:** He's got no audience and we can make a newer, bigger, better combat zone!\u000a5. **Eleanor:** You save her dog, nuff said.\u000a6. **Kent Connolly:** The Silver Shroud's sidekick doesn't need to live in the memory den, reliving old stories when he's become a living breathing part of his dream. He can get a radio tower anywhere and broadcast his stories/ news to you in safety.\u000a7. **Any of the wandering traders you can't already recruit:** Everyone needs a home right?\u000a8. **Shelly Tiller:** She could really use some protection and you could have offered it!\u000a9. **Kyle, Kate, Alissa:** These dogs need a new owner!\u000a10. **Pickman:** If you let him live I bet you are his only friend alive.\u000a11. **The Peabodys:** A family of gouls isn't safe out all alone in a world full of bigots and people that want to exploit their immortality.\u000a12. **Sarge:** I can hack robots, he could be useful, has a history serving minutemen. Why do I have to kill him?\u000a13. **Donny Kowalski:** Another kid living all alone and this one doesn't even have the great green wall to protect him, sign.\u000a14. **Darla:** I mean she ran away from home and no one says she has to go back, just write home once in a while to let them know you are safe girl!\u000a15. **Skinny Malone:** He may not like you since you and Nick are the cause of his crew  abandoning him but he needs a place to live and has shown some honor in letting you leave peacefully. Maybe you could help him turn his life around?\u000a16. **Bill Sutton:** Such a tragedy his story is. Is awful husband and father so family leaves him. Tries to turn things around at Warwick farms. SS steps in (if allied to Institute) when he figures out that Rodger is a synth. Finally he says he needs to go away for a while and later kills himself by jumping into a pool of water. Why couldn't we give him a place to live and say "Let's just start anew man, fuck the past and Warwick farms. Just come live in _____  and be happy."\u000a17. **Cedric Hopton:** He was just in it for the caps and wanted to just leave with the money Bill gave him, offer him a home you dingus!\u000a18. **Fred and Angie:** They just lost their friend Jules no matter how you solve the issue with them, they are going to need a place to recuperate and maybe settle down.\u000a19. **Art:** This dude has been attacked by at least 10 synth replaces on one of my characters, this dude is high priority target and needs some protection apparently.\u000a20. **Bethany:** You do realize that by living over super radiation you're never going to get a patient willing to come see you, right doctor? "Come run a clinic in _____!"\u000a21. **Charlie and Clinton:** They deserve to get off that damn road. A father's love isn't enough to protect someone sometimes unfortunately.\u000a22. **Kat and Gus:** another kid living alone, at least this one has a badass body guard.\u000a23. **Leonard Moore:** This guy just wants to run a business, give him a good location!\u000a24. **Mac:** Runs a bar in the wild, complains that settlements cost to much to run in, give him a discount?\u000a25. **Manta Man:** This guy is going to get himself killed with his delusion, let him fantasize he's a super hero where he's safe. \u000a26. **Mikey and Moss:** I liked these guys and their argument involving what is a sandwich. Give them a home so they can eat as many as they want!\u000a27. **Opal:** She lives on a roof, while it's a safesh place I doubt she has many customers for her business.\u000a28. **Parker Quinn:** I hate this asshole, let that be known. He never fooled me but I bet his sales skills have fooled others before. Why can't I offer him a better life where he doesn't have to rip people off. (I'd probably just kill him still but I'd like the option.)\u000a29. **Preston Garvey impersonator:** This guy is trying to profit of Preston's name, I think he might learn a thing or two about living a decent life if he met the real Preston Garvey. (Guess he would need a real name then.)\u000a30. **Ricky Dalton:** He helps you in Tradecraft if you decide to go that route, offer him a safe house as a reward!\u000a31. **Theodore Collins:** This guy is nasty and making people sick but if offered another life maybe he wouldn't have to stoop to such deplorable business practices.\u000a\u000aThat's quite a few npcs that could have been given a deeper meaning and Bethesda could have made more! Does anyone else think that at least some of these npcs could be great settler potential? Thanks for reading, I have a *small* obsession with larger than life posts.\u000a\u000a**TL;DR** Bethesda could have made settlements much more lively if they simply let us offer the good, bad, and the ugly people of the Commonwealth a better home. \u000a\u000aEDIT: [He's your damn proof people] (http://imgur.com/rOsMYM6)

p3146
sI2
VGenerally focus on techs that get you science buildings. But also try as much as possible to avoid working any specialist slots that aren't for scientist, because you just don't want to generate any unwanted great people 
p3147
sI3
VI play a lot of science victories on higher difficulties, and don't think the "not working any specialists except scientists" is a good idea. Obviously, you want to avoid merchants, but a couple of GE's can be a really huge boost for some key science wonders such as Porcelain Tower, Leaning Tower, and of course, Hubble. Plus, working engineer specialists gets you science with rationalism! Sure, you might have 1 less scientist by the time you bulb them all, but by working engineers you can get to that point faster, and your science per turn and science per scientist bulbed will be higher. Yes, scientists are more important than engineers, but if you have enough food to work both of them then there's no reason not to go for it.
p3148
sI4
VYeap, I agree. That's why I said try as much as possible. However I don't believe you'll need more than 1 or 2 GEs since you'd probably have developed a tech lead so you won't need GEs for the later wonders
p3149
sI5
VAh, the "as much as possible" qualification :) Got it!\u000a\u000aI think I agree with the 1-2 GE's being optimal for a couple of key mid-game wonders. Hopefully late game you have enough faith to buy a GE for Hubble.

V>Black, as in the skin color of modern people from Nigeria?\u000a\u000aSince you're qualifying it like that - were skin colors actually very different back then?
p3154
sI2
V... What do you mean? Of course a diversity of skin tone existed. Ethiopians are explicitly called very black by Greek chroniclers.\u000a\u000a"Race" as we conceive it didn't exactly exist back then. There were plenty of ways beside skin tone to judge out-groups.
p3155
sI3
V>What do you mean?\u000a\u000aIf they say "_modern_ people from Nigeria", that implies that people in Nigeria at the time had a different skin color, either because the colors themselves were different or because the geographical distribution was. And if that was the case, it likely wasn't exclusively so for Nigeria. So it's not entirely absurd to ask, lots of things can happen over millennia.
p3156
sI4
VHe's just using a reference. The people in what is now Nigeria have been black for millennia. In fact, given the similarity in skin tone between Africans and Papuans, I'd say that black was the original skin tone and others have developed in the tens of millennia since humans spread out over the Earth.

VI tried explaining this to some of my friends but they didn't really get me. So I came here in hopes of finding someone that can relate. I'm not even sure this is something bad about the game.\u000a\u000aIt's the music.\u000a\u000aI'll use the White orchard theme as an example, it's the first one I noticed since it's the first area in the game.\u000a\u000aIt's so goddamn beautiful and well done, but it makes me so deeply sad sometimes, to the point where I'm almost not enjoying myself. I played a lot of games that have sad events that are complemented by good, fitting music, like [The microwave scene](#spoiler) in MGS 4, [Zeke's death](#spoiler) in Infamous 2, and [The ending](#spoiler) in Demon's Souls and Dark Souls, as well as some bosses there. Among many other games.\u000a\u000aI'd go back and listen to the OST and go 'damn that part was sad, what a game' then I move right the hell on. It's different with some of TW3's soundtrack, like the one in Velen around (but not inside) The Bloody Baron's place, and the Ard Skellig theme.\u000a\u000aIt's unreal, and only rarely happens with some very select games, I'm really thankful I don' t remember any of them, that way I won't remember their soundtracks.\u000a\u000aBasically what I'm saying is that some of the soundtracks get me so sad that takes me out of the game, or at least makes me feel something akin to sadness but so much more intense.\u000a\u000aI don't remember feeling this way towards TW2's music. So does anyone feel the same? Even with another game? Because this is driving me insane.
p3161
sI1
VI love the music itself, it's amazing. I just hate how it makes me feel, it's the weirdest feeling that I wish I didn't have. I guess it's it's nice to experience it once but after a while it puts a damp on my mood.\u000a\u000aI'm not criticizing the game either, just discussing this thing with the music.
p3162
sI2
VRight. That's the point of the music, its to make you feel something. For most people it actually gets them more immersed in the game, not only are they seeing and playing it but hearing something that makes them feel how the main character would feel. It sets the mood and adds context to a scene/place without stopping gameplay to explain with text how the characters or place is supposed to feel.\u000a
p3163
sI3
VI have a feeling you don't really get what I mean, as I said I don't mind sad music that fits the situation, this is just different.\u000a\u000aI guess I couldn't explain it. Again.\u000a\u000aOn a completely separate note: Sometimes the sad area's music plays over funny dialogue and it's weird, that is all.
p3164
sI4
VEasy way to fix that is to just turn music off and make a witcher 2 soundtrack playlist to play on the background you won't be disappointed cause its almost the same vibe just not so sad just like you said. I did a similar thing when I got bored of skyrim's music or diablo's.

VGili Trawangan is the place to go if you want to get your partying fix, so much better than trashy Kuta. In Ubud, I stayed there for two nights, did some downhill cycling down Batur Volcano, rented a scooter and drove up north to Lovina to see some dolphins, spent the night there, and drove back. In Ubud, the people I was with just walked around and picked a place with an awesome infinity pool and decent room. It was about $20 for a double room, split between two people. I'm sorry I can't remember the name but you will be fine! Lots of good places to stay. \u000a\u000aLet me know if you need any info on the Gili Islands, I was in Indonesia for a month back in May

VWhat explains why it is not uncommon for victims of past trauma to experience more traumas, often of a similar nature, often more than one time and sometimes repeatedly?\u000a\u000aA therapist of mine who I talked to briefly about this gave a couple of reasons but we ran out of time and it didn't sound like a comprehensive list.\u000a\u000aI venture to put forth that victims understanding why this happens can help us better learn to protect ourselves.\u000a\u000aPlease include what your credentials are in your answers, and if your knowledge comes from research, listening to patients, or both.

p3182
sI1
VThanks for the reply. I completely agree.\u000a\u000aI'll just lay out what the therapist of mine who I asked about this said, and explain a bit more about where I'm coming from.\u000a\u000aThe two reasons he outlined, which he only went into briefly because we ran out of time, were:\u000a\u000a1) victims of trauma tend to dissociate and that can somehow lead them to be less prepared to defend themselves or have normal defenses in place which can contribute to revictimization\u000a\u000a2) there are, in his words, "bad people" who specifically target people they perceive to be weaker\u000a\u000aI was skeptical of the first point because, as you said, it does tread into victim-blaming territory. I also didn't fully understand it because he didn't explain it much because we ran out of time, but from my lived experience, I didn't understand why dissociation would contribute to revictimization.  However, from my lived experience, I think it's possible there are other things from PTSD from the victim's side that could contribute to revictimization, but because I'm not sure what they are, I would like to know what the research about it has been.\u000a\u000aThe second point I wholeheartedly agree with and anyone who is familiar with research on abusers or research on sociopathic personalities knows that people like that make it a point to deliberately target and break down people who they perceive as weak and know they can break down.  Because victims of trauma or abuse often show low self-esteem already, that might make them more vulnerable. To be clear, even if they have good self-esteem, abusers know how to spot people who are mentally ill or who they perceive as different or weaker in other ways, that can make them a prime target for these types of people.  I want to clarify the people who get targeted aren't always really weaker, but they frequently are perceived as different, weaker, or inferior, and that's why you often get sociopathic personalities targeting women, minorities, and other people in marginalized groups. It's not that they're weaker but that they'll get less support from larger society if they are victimized and sociopathic personalities and abuser probably include that in their criteria for picking victims. I want to clarify about that because it's also possible there is nothing that contributes to revictimization from the victims' side except merely being perceived as different.\u000a\u000aI'm interested in research about both types of things.  However, I think there needs to be far more awareness about the second point, about how abusers pick their victims, and that large portions of the population - 1/25 I've heard for sociopathic personalities- go around making a game out of it.  I think there needs to be far more awareness about that contribution to revictimization because despite how obvious that connection should be I have not heard people mention it much.  I completely agree with you that victim-blaming is dangerous and my opinion is that mental health labels actually encourage victim-blaming so I think there needs to be a better understanding of why revictimization occurs from a realistic, non victim-blaming point of view.\u000a\u000aThank you for the article. I haven't read it yet but I will.

VIt's focused on IPV and it's pretty "basic" (because it's a seminal text on the motives of abusers) but it has some great insight. Also,\u000a\u000a> I want to clarify the people who get targeted aren't always really weaker, but they frequently are perceived as different, weaker, or inferior, and that's why you often get sociopathic personalities targeting women, minorities, and other people in marginalized groups. \u000a\u000aThis isn't exactly related to what you're saying, but this struck a chord with me because I've been reading about Rape Myth Acceptance (a really interesting field of psych research, if you're unfamiliar) and abusers with high RMA also tend to be sexist and racist.

VAlright guys, so it may be premature, but I'm betting that the Blazers will make the playoffs this year.  That means we lose our first rounder, and therefore I think it could be a real possibility that we look to buy our way into the 2nd Round (Thank you Uncle Allen).  Now, this begs the question: Where do we buy in, and who do we pick?\u000a\u000aAs far as where, I took the liberty of going through and selecting teams that I believe would be willing to sell there 2nd round pick either because:\u000a\u000a* A. They already have a multitude of 2nd round picks (Boston has 5 alone this year)\u000a\u000a*or*\u000a\u000a* B. The team doesn't have the need to take on a project player and would prefer the cash intake\u000a\u000aThis leaves us with a few possibilities listed below:\u000a\u000a* Boston - (31, 35, 46, 52, 58)\u000a* Milwaukee - (36, 40)\u000a* Orlando - (41, 48)\u000a* Utah - (42, 54, 60)\u000a* Atlanta - (43, 51)\u000a* Charlotte - (50)\u000a* Cleveland - (55)\u000a\u000aA few teams I left off this list include the Rockets (well, because, fuck the rockets) and the Spurs (they have a hard-on for international players in the 2nd round).  I think picks between 31 and around 40 are out the window too because these are your high value picks where you can get 1st round talent without guaranteeing a contract, and picks after 54 are one's that you don't pay for because chances are the person you're looking at will go undrafted and you can swoop them after the draft.\u000a\u000aSo we're left with 41, 42, 43, 48, 50, 51.  So who do we target in this pick range then?  Big men, maybe a SG/SF wing type player as safety valve incase Hendo and Crabbe sign elsewhere this offseason.  Below are the players I like in that pick range that I think we can take some flyer's with because they either have potential, or I could see them becoming instant contributors off the bench:\u000a\u000a* **Joel Bolomboy** - We like seniors out of Weber State, and rebounding/shooting always translate to the NBA (Weber State, 22, 6'9, 230, 17.2 ppg 12.7 rpg on 58/36/70)\u000a* **Malcolm Brogdon** - Could be an instant 3 and D guy out of college (Virginia, 23, 6'5, 18.7 ppg 4.1 rpg, 2.8 apg on 47/41/88)\u000a* **Chris Boucher** - Overall interesting talent who has only been playing basketball for about 3-4 years.  Shot blocking is a strength, has good range, but has a very slight frame.  (Oregon, 23, 6'10, 12.1 ppg 7.6 rpg on 54/36/69)\u000a* **Jarron Blossongame** - good range, plays big for his size though could be a bit of a tweener at the next level (Clemson, 23, 6'7, 18.7 ppg 6.7 rpg on 51/45/78)\u000a* **Zhou Qi** - Most intriguing prospect out of the bunch as he's 7'2 has good north-south mobility, good shot blocking skills and has range out to the 3 point line.  Could be a poor man's Porzingis if he works on his effort level which is come and go in the CBA, as well as his slight frame (China, 20, 7'2, 15.8 ppg 9.76 rpg on 60/60/76)\u000a* **Michael Gbinije** - Another 3 and D prospect that I could see coming out and being a solid part of a bench rotation from the get-go (Syracuse, 23, 6'7, 17.8 ppg, 4.1 rpg 4.4 apg on 48/41/67)\u000a* **Vasilis Charalampopoulos** - This guy probably actually isn't going to come out in this draft, but seeing as how I wasn't old enough to have my own disposable income when Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje was around, I want this guy for the purely selfish reason of having a jersey that says Charalampopoulos. (Greece, 6'8, 19, who gives a fuck about stats? Look at that last name)\u000a\u000a*Disclaimer* - Draft positions are going to change a lot during the NCAA tournament, and even more during personal workouts, so some of these guys may be long gone by the pick range of 41-51, and some of these guys may later on prove to be nowhere near the cost of a draft pick, so take all the suggestions made above with a grain of salt.

(dp3262

VI've been seeing a lot about the recent debacle regarding DLC, and companies shipping games with part of the DLC already on the disk, or companies having DLC ready but not shipping it out, so here's my take, and it probably doesn't mesh with the majority of /r/gaming, but whatever...\u000a\u000aNow, I'm not talking about a game that's released with vital content missing that's released later, I'm talking about addons, whether they're an added side mission, added gear or items, or new themes or skins. You know, things that are fluff, or that **add** content to the game rather than fixing something broken.\u000a\u000aAlso, I can understand the argument that a company might release a half-assed game for full price because they expect people to buy DLC. I understand the frustration there and I don't think companies should do that, but I've seen people argue against DLC even when the base game was full, complete, and had plenty of content.\u000a\u000aFor example, let's say I make a game, and the story is full and complete, no missing content, no cut corners, and sell it. Let's also say that while I was making this game, I also had some people working on an expansion to the game and both were ready at the same time. Why is it that the gaming community suddenly believes that they're entitled to both the game AND the expansion for the price of just the game? Each product took its own hours to produce. Even two titles produced concurrently still require their own man hours to make. Why do gamers get the feeling that they're entitled to everything a company puts out on a single franchise?\u000a\u000aI'm a gamer, so it's not like I don't know the gaming side of the issue. However, if I buy a game and it's full and complete, why should I care if the company has already produced several DLC packs for the game that I didn't get? I didn't pay for them, so why should I be entitled to them?\u000a\u000aI'm not sure if it's just general "anti-corporate greed" mentality or what, but I still fail to understand why gamers hate DLC so much.\u000a\u000aSo, can someone please explain what reason there is to hate DLC besides the issues I stated above?\u000a\u000a**TL;DR -** Please explain why there's so much hatred directed at paying for DLC if the base game has a fair amount of content for the price.

VI'm not saying that it's the only option available for companies. There are obviously several methods in order to earn extra revenue. However, many larger companies (like EA) do this. 
p3265
sI3
V>In order to make money in order to front the cash for these things, they must sell more product; DLC takes less time to create than starting a new game, and it sells easier because it's a familiar setting for the players. \u000a\u000ai believe from the examples i gave it ranged form indie<small<decent sized<large company. you can see that there are companies who are various sized companies in the gaming market who dont go the DLC route and yet are able to make profit.

VAlright. So there's this girl I've been talking to for a while now. I know that she likes me; of course, I could be wrong but her behavior says otherwise. She gets really close to me, leans against me, etc. It's either I'm hated, or she really likes me and she is nervous (by no ways am I friendzoned because she treats me differently from other guys/girls/etc).\u000a\u000aSo, I know that she likes me. And I'm pretty sure she knows that I like her. But... I think she saw me texting another girl last Thursday, who is one of my closest friends. She's just a friend, nothing more, nothing less. But, she was looking at my screen and I think she got a misunderstanding of the intention I was texting for. She started to get weird after she saw me text her.\u000a\u000aShe would take glances at me and she would make eye contact, but she wouldn't say anything. She would make physical contact (chest, arm, etc.) but wouldn't actually say anything to me. She seems to be in a state of nervousness, but I don't know how to break her out of it. If I try to talk to her, she just freezes... Making it awkward for the both of us. How do I break out of this?\u000a\u000aBy the way, we aren't dating yet.\u000a\u000a   \u000atl;dr: Girl acts awkward around me. What do I do?

VBought a 2013 VW Golf R (10k miles) on May 25. Came with several months remaining on factory warranty, plus 2 year/24k mile CPO warranty. During the test drive I noticed some issues with the alignment. The salesman assured me the dealership would address the alignment. While signing papers, I was told they had a tech drive it and they didn't notice anything (I know - I shouldn't have signed until it was addressed). Salesman helped me juggle cars that night to get my old car back. I drove him on the interstate and showed him that there really is an issue with the alignment. That night, I also noticed the tweeter in the A-pillar was blown. He told me I could bring it in to have those items addressed. \u000a\u000a\u000aFast forward to May 28, I noticed vibrations when applying moderate braking and texted the salesman. At this point I was eager to get the car in for service. Dropped it off for service on Wednesday June 3. The shop originally wanted me to pay for the alignment (the salesman honored his word, do not have to pay for that), they wanted me to pay for the tweeter (~$50 including deductible), and they said the rotors would have to be replaced. Then the shop decides that they may just be able to cut the rotors instead. Then they decide that the runout on the rotors is indeed outside the acceptable tolerance for VW approved repair (VW limit: +/- 0.1mm; my car: +/- 0.3mm). Dealership proceeds to quote me ~$400 for rotor replacement. The dealership ordered rotors for the car without my consent. They told me that they will work to "minimize" my cost, but IMO I shouldn't have to pay for anything.\u000a\u000aThursday June 4 I contacted VW directly. They have opened a case with the regional representative who will follow up with the dealership today. For what it's worth, the 112 point VW CPO inspection explicitly calls out "no abnormal noise" from the brakes on the road test portion. My argument for this case is that if the person certifying the car was negligent enough to miss alignment and a blown tweeter, they are likely negligent enough to miss brake vibrations.\u000a\u000a**TL;DR:** Bought CPO. Discovered issues with alignment/tweeter/brake rotors. Dealership honored repairs on alignment/tweeter. TBD if they will replace the rotors at no cost to me.\u000a\u000a**Please, any advice navigating this is much appreciated. Thanks!**\u000a\u000a**EDIT: UPDATE** They're going to fix everything, free of charge! It's the right thing to do, and now I'm happy to say I've had a great experience with VW and this dealership. Thank you all for your words!\u000a\u000aEdit: clarifications\u000a\u000a

VSo glad to hear that! That's exactly what I found when I searched for their CPO checklist - two sections with items discussing brakes/rotors: #104 underbody section, and #69 (giggity) under road test is **Brakes/ABS: Operational/Responsive/No Abnormal Noise**\u000a\u000aI personally reached out to VW and they have escalated the case to a regional service representative. That rep will reach out to the dealership by COB today. I'm really crossing my fingers, because this just seems *wrong*. Thank you!
p3292
sI2
VYou should be fine.  The dealer probably rolled the dice, hoping whoever bought the car wouldn't notice, and if they did they could get them to pay.  He rolled snake eyes.  The service rep will make him do the rotors.  Make sure they examine the pads while they are in there, too; if the rotors are scored they probably ruined the pads, so those should get done, too.  Unless they are brand-new, I would make sure they get changed in the process, even if you have to buy them.  Nothing like brand-new brakes, especially in an R model ;-)
p3293
sI3
VHeh. Thanks =] \u000a\u000aSeeing that the person who certified the car missed THREE pretty blatant items (alignment, tweeter, and brakes), do you think there's any chance of having VW re-certify the car? Have you ever heard of anyone doing this? I think it's worth asking because at this point, I cannot trust that the technician adequately certified all other inspection points.
p3294
sI4
VIt couldn't hurt to ask, because pretty clearly some corners were cut.  And the manufacturers tend to be pretty protective of their CPO programs.  I would definitely bring it up.

VTitle is pretty clear.\u000a\u000aI travel to the Hartford, CT area semi-often for work and have been enjoying band 12 coverage there for a while now. I recently updated my Moto E LTE (2015) to 5.1 Lollipop.  On my most recent trips, I've again lost service in areas where band 12 only service existed and worked for me.  I flashed back down to 5.0.1 and the band 12 service areas returned as normal.  Not sure what Motorola was thinking here but it's not what I like to see.\u000a\u000aEdit:  Back from my travels so it's time to update.  Wow the band 12 coverage makes a difference.  I upgraded to 5.1 again and lost band 12 again.  I tried the 5.0.2 radios on the 5.1 image and lost all connectivity.  Downgrading to 5.0.2 returned band 12.

p3320
sI1
VNice! I appreciate it! These are all effects that you can get where exactly?
p3321
sI2
VSure thing! Haha, I was just typing up an edit about how to do this with Live but you were faster than I was :) Live Suite has an electric piano soundalike called Electric, which can be used to make Rhodes-y sounds since a Rhodes is just a famous electric piano. Leslie speakers are these cool rotating speakers that Rhodes and Hammond players use, and while I know there are some dedicated third-party emulations out there I haven't had much hands-on time with them myself. \u000a\u000aI don't have Live in front of me to see how close I am, but off the top of my head, using just Live Suite's tools, try one of the Electric presets -> Overdrive or Saturator -> Auto Pan -> Auto Filter -> Phaser -> Reverb.\u000a\u000aPlay with the drive on Overdrive/Saturator until it's present but not a super obvious effect. You're just building the body up. You can probably do this with parallel compression too. Set Auto Pan so the waveforms are in sync, and make them more sine-y than square-y, to emulate a rotary cabinet. Choose a rate that matches the sound you want, and probably turn the amount down so it isn't completely eliminating the sound during the valleys. Set Auto Filter to lowpass and adjust to taste to de-emphasize the highs, as this is a more mellow sound. I'm not sure what all to do with phaser, but find a setting and set the LFO to a fairly slow speed since I'm pretty sure it moves over the course of several beats.\u000a\u000aIf you don't have Live Suite but just Live, you won't have Electric but you can probably fake something with Operator. And if you do have Suite you can probably substitute Amp/Cabinet for Overdrive and there are probably lots of other tricks you can do but this is just what I came up with now.\u000a\u000aHope this helps!

VGlad to help! Again I'm no expert, but I think it's just mainly vamping on one chord until the chorus.

I'm pretty bad at picking this sort of thing out though.

Slams, two handed throws, lots of Armor on beasts with higher DEF than my 'jacks, and that don't  need to pass those fury checks. I have only ever won through desperate assassination gambits. I have really struggled, especially on scenarios, and find that even if I annihilate two or three of his heavies on an alpha I get brutalized the next turn. So many times I've had things beaten into range to get two handed thrown into my caster, or some rushed charging grandslam blows my jack back 8 inches over my caster, or he just follows up and buys more attacks. He's got even more titans, cyclops, paingivers and some worm thing ready to go for fifty point games as well so I am not expecting any relief there either.\u000a\u000aHow would you Khador the out-Khadoring Khador beast brick Komrades?

VThanks for the thoughts CommissarJ, I haven't tried Man-O-Wars against him as I have in my head they'd just become bowling pins. But I will give them a try next time! I tried the great bears and they died horrible deaths after not quite killing their target. I was underwhelmed sadly.\u000aI do love me some snipers, and I try and bomb the paingivers to pieces as well with indirect fire if I can. The not caring about Fury when near the Bronzeback let's him go absolutely crazy with it, and that's just a tough thing to crack when there's three Gladiators in front of it. I have never quite groked Strakov anyways but I will take your advice and not try and learn him here. Also yes. I took Karchev once. Because I threw my hands in the air and said screw it.\u000aIt makes me happy to hear that the Iron Fangs are who I should be taking because I just finished one unit and am building a second. I will try and use them to deliver the Demo Corps maybe?
p3387
sI2
VGo with the idea that you're gonna get trampled and you need to make a good play when it happens. A high def tarpit with a hard hitting second line is essential. Great bears, warjacks, and demo-corps fulfill that role perfectly. Nyss hunters with Iron Flesh would super frustrate him as opposed to Kayazy (because their weapons are kind of weak).\u000a\u000aKeep your man-o-wars alive until they reach the front line. Weaponmasters that get a charge in will really hurt warbeasts. Iron Fang kovniks will prevent the knockdowns of your scattered Iron Fangs that should pair up and spread out. Add Fury to Iron Fangs for epic destruction. Manhunters can block the alpha charges to your jacks and be deadly counters. Great Bears should be handled with ease but once they arrive... omg knock out anything that can be disabled. Any other jack you have should be second line with charge lanes blocked. Unless you want to bait him with a Berserker (awesome for eSorcha bond)\u000a\u000aI suggest you leave the following out of your lists (but it's ultimately your call): Mortars, Destroyers, Decimators, Kossite woodsman, Greylord ternions.\u000a\u000aA funny combo you can do, Kov Joe gives Wintergaurd riflemen an extra dice to hit, Butcher feat, 3 dice to hit and 3 to damage on everything you can before you charge with the rest. But I really dont recommend shooties in against this many warbeasts (unless you have a field gun?). \u000a\u000aFor psychological warfare, add doomreavers on your front line. They make everybody very very nervous and they always get prioritized. Lure your opponent in with doomies (with escort) and manhunters on the flanks, and you counter hard after he comes to you (use iron fangs here).
p3388
sI3
VThanks CommissarJ for the thoughts. Demo-Corps is getting a lot of love, I'll give them a try as a second line.\u000a\u000aPoint of order on your exclusion list; is there *ever* a list (beyond old witch where you *have* to include them for the free Yuri) where putting Kossite Woodsmen in is even remotely the right decision?\u000a\u000aI've thought long and hard about the riflecorps and I'm just not  sanguine on them being able to crack the ARM 19 on the Titans. Even with Butcher's feat rolling three dice they're still at pow 10, dice-9 means an average roll will get me 1-2 points. Assuming all of them hit and it averages out, that twenty points is still not enough to kill even one let alone four, which is why I haven't brought them. I feel like that'd be brutal against higher ARM infantry though, so I'm totally going to try it. Just not against this list.\u000a\u000aDoomreavers. I just... okay, I'll give them a try too (but after the Democorps).
p3389
sI4
VRemember you can play your opponent on the table and their mind. Kossite woodsmen are mostly a psychological play. Most opponents you have wont know their stats and will freak out a little bit, especially if they run their caster in the back or if you're playing scenario. Doom reavers are much better at it because... I mean face it... they're scary. I've seen people dedicate 2-3 units of shooting trying to deal with a 6-8 point unit.... meanwhile, everything else creeps up while the doomies lock and jam.\u000a\u000aWhen you make your list, throw in as many melee as you can. Doom Reavers, Demo Corps, Iron fangs (kovnik), great bears, manhunters, and even regular shock troopers are the key to your success.

Also, I was thinking about using an SSD as a cache. Suggestions? would it be worth the extra few dollars? Also, I will be getting rid of the WD Blue. Its just whats in the extra PC right now. If you have any ideas for it, let me know.

Do you know of a good video or article explaining what you meant by ZFS pool or logical volume group? If not I can find one. I'm a huge newb with NAS stuff, sorry! I'll also have to figure out about bonding all the ethernet interfaces.
p3402
sI2
VIts always fun the first time you are setting up something like this :)\u000a\u000aAre you planning on using Windows or a *nix OS?\u000a\u000aI personally prefer Linux, I have setup my NAS with [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/). However there are some good BSD based distros that cater specifically for NAS builds, like [FreeNAS](http://www.freenas.org/); However I have personally never used it.\u000a\u000aThere are quite a bit of Resources available for settting up ZFS or logical volume groups in Linux. Once you decide a distro to use, most of the linux distro wiki's have pretty comprehensive information on these topics now a days!\u000a\u000aedit: I forget to mention for bonding (or link aggregation) to work both the end points should support it. I.e, Your NAS and your Switch/Router. I have a [managed cisco switch](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OA721C?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage) which suppport [LACP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_aggregation).

VI will probably be using something like FreeNAS. Unless there is something simpler and more user friendly that does daily automatic Full backups & snapshots of my PC. I'm not sure if FreeNAS does all of that, but I'm sure it does some of it. Do you know of anything that might do that?\u000a\u000aAs for ZFS & logical volume groups and link aggregation, I will research all of those. Can never learn too much!
p3404

VFor your criteria, FreeNAS would fit the bill perfectly.\u000aThey support OpenZFS out of the box as well. \u000aAnd looking at their [features](http://www.freenas.org/about/features.html), they support most common backup services across nix/osx/windows.\u000a\u000aThey have quite a few good plugins to extend your NAS's functionalty as well.

VUnfortunately there isn't. I just used a crack for my version of windows 7. I've done this with about 5 different PCs. The only part that's risky is finding a download you can trust, which none of them are really since it's technically illegal (no one ever gets introuble from this though). Once you get the program you run it, pick your version and run it. \u000a\u000aMaybe check piratebay.se and search windows 8. Find one that's highly rated, liked, and read comments. Usually they will have a download that will come with windows and the crack for it. \u000a\u000aThere is a risk doing this though. So if you decide to do this. Do it with caution and at your own risk.

VAJ was in the same league in NJPW with anywhere from four to six other guys. As a big match wrestler, he was at best No. 2 behind Tanahashi and it's not a lock he was No. 2. And the other three to five guys all worked much harder schedules.  \u000a  \u000aHe's nowhere near the best ever.  \u000a  \u000aShawn beats AJ on charisma. AJ kills Shawn on creativity, but Shawn never had a period where he worked two years with the kind of guys AJ did to bring his game up to that level and open his mind. And he never had so many guys of his own ability to push him to have to improve to even be competitive at the top level. So he was better than a much worse field (with a few exceptions like Bret who worked a more realistic and gripping style but wasn't as athletically gifted) but just because of that field, he was never as complete in as many ways as AJ had to become or he'd fail.

VI don't remember the name, I just saw a bunch of chevrons and symbols next to the name in the fleet window, then jumped to find the fleet(Which can be hard to do, I jumped in on 10 WTs at a gate after I jumped in on the FC and lost my ship, noob mistake).
p3455
sI2
VHey, you warped to my alt, who was cloaked in a hostile system, in a safespot. I apologize for kicking you, that was the 3rd time (in that fleet) that someone had done that, all the while I was talking about doing the same to kill the hostile fleet booster. I'm paranoid about my command ship (It's expensive as fuck, couple hundred mil), and really need to break people's habit of warping to leadership.  \u000a  \u000aI'm already going to start putting the memo in every fleet MOTD, and mentioning it a bit more.

VI'm not really sure in Dutch 'Communie' is where the whole body and blood of Christ thing happens and that was always the event were the kids would get presents afterwords. \u000a\u000aI can't find the Dutch equivalent of conformation (I keep getting the same results as communion) so I don't know if they are both practiced in the Netherlands or they are the same thing.\u000a\u000aI was sort of raised a protestant in a catholic region (also went to a catholic school) so I didn't really participate in anything like it aside from some school activities.

VFirst Communion (primary school age): You receive Jesus' body (communion) for the first time. Before that, you can't eat bread or drink wine.\u000a\u000aConfirmation (~14yo): You confirm that you actually believe in this stuff, since you were baptised before you could form an opinion.\u000a\u000aOf course, people who have been raised in a religious household might not have formed an opionion on their own by the age of 14, but that's the basic idea behind it.

VI still wonder if there might not be a new dual GPU card in the wings waiting for when the consumer HMDs hit. Nvidia explained before how SLI could only get a 40-50% performance increase with two cards instead of the factor of two many were expecting but a lot of that could be made up if images weren't having to be shuttled across a PCIe bus and all commands duplicated. Add some new and special instructions to write to both eyes at the same time (which Nvidia still likely wouldn't support for another year), and share a bit of memory for textures and output images and they might be able to even get better than the previously-expected factor of two.\u000a\u000aOr not.\u000a\u000aBut one can hope...
p3478
sI2
VIf they can get anywhere near 80% increase with 2 card SLI, wow. Although greater than a two factor increase has to conflict with some law of physics.
p3479
sI3
VBut that's the thing. Nvidia themselves said SLI will only get about a 40-50% speed boost. Commands are duplicated, memory moves are duplicated, and images have to be shipped across the PCI bus for time warping, warping, and combining into one image for output to the HMD.\u000a\u000aI have no idea what the benefits would actually be from a dual GPU card, but if you don't need to duplicate commands, texture loads, and ship images back and forth over the PCI bus, I wonder if there might not be a 2x increase and maybe even more.
p3480
sI4
VI was under the impression that AMD got their SLI working much closer to 100% then Nvidia (because their approach didn't have the same bottlenecks).  Can someone confirm?\u000a\u000aAnd does the PCI bus handle broadcast communication?  I wonder if the long term solution is hardware changes on the motherboard to allow texture loading to happen to both when it makes sense.

VI'm trying to read RS232 data from a Keyence RS232 module connected to two laser sensors, but nothing seems to be working the way I thought it would. I've simply hooked up the RS232 module directly to my Mega via Rx, Tx, and Gnd. The Keyence module is set to transmit repeatedly without need for any commands, and if I print serial data I can see a stream of repeating numbers. \u000a\u000a    \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a    void setup() {\u000a	// Turn the Serial Protocol ON\u000a	Serial.begin(9600);\u000a	\u000a    }\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a    void loop() {\u000a	char start = 77;\u000a	char terminator = 10;\u000a	char carriage = 13;\u000a\u000a	while(Serial.available()) {\u000a		Serial.println(Serial.read());    //Device only sends if this line is included\u000a		if (Serial.read() == start)\u000a		{\u000a			Serial.println("start dedtected"); //start byte detector\u000a		}\u000a		if (Serial.read() == carriage) {\u000a			Serial.print("carriage return detected");\u000a\u000a		}\u000a		if (Serial.read() == terminator) {\u000a			Serial.print("line feed detected");  //end byte detector\u000a			while (true) {\u000a				delay(1000);  //halt \u000a		}\u000a		\u000a		}\u000a		\u000a	}\u000a	\u000a    }\u000a\u000aMy problem is that unless I use Serial.print(), the rs232 module doesn't repeatedly send any data. The send LED only blinks once when I turn the unit on, and I get nothing happening from my code. \u000a\u000aIt seems like Serial.read() would take the incoming data at each loop iteration and confirm that it was read so that the RS232 unit would continue to transmit. Am I missing something?
p3514
sI1
VWow. Thank you for taking the time to explain that to me. I guess I had the wrong idea on how Serial.read() operates. \u000a\u000aI've since taken another's advice to call it just once per loop iteration by assigning it a variable and then using that variable for my comparisons. \u000a\u000aI'm still not able to get any data though, unless I include a line to print my variable with serial.print(). If I leave this line out, the RS232 module does not repeatedly send any data. Here's what I'm using now: \u000a\u000a    void loop() {\u000a	byte start = 93;\u000a	byte delimiter = 10;\u000a	byte carriage = 13;\u000a	byte databyte = 0;\u000a\u000a	while(Serial.available()) {\u000a		databyte = Serial.read();\u000a		Serial.println(databyte);    //Device only sends repeatedly if this line is included\u000a		if (databyte == start)\u000a		{\u000a			Serial.print("start dedtected"); //start byte detector\u000a		}\u000a		if (databyte == carriage) {\u000a			Serial.print("carriage return detected");\u000a\u000a		}\u000a		if (databyte == delimiter) {\u000a			Serial.print("line feed detected");  //end byte detector\u000a			while (true) {\u000a				delay(1000);  //halt \u000a		}\u000a		\u000a		}\u000a		\u000a	}

V> If I leave this line out, the RS232 module does not repeatedly send any data.\u000a\u000aI'm sure it's sending the data, you're just not doing anything with it in your code so you never see it. You need an 'if' case if the byte is *not* 'start', 'carriage', or 'delimiter', otherwise it falls through all your cases and just reads the next byte (if available, on another pass through the loop.)
p3516
sI3
VIt's genuinely not sending anything. The module has a Tx LED that blinks a lot when I use the print command, but doesn't blink otherwise. I tried making other cases instead of printing, but so far I've still had no luck.

V**Richard**\u000a\u000aRichard traced the lines of his father's palm, examining every groove and wrinkle with great care. He'd done it a thousand times before, when he was younger. Whenever Arlorn held him in his arms, he would count the lines in his palm and silently count the ever increasing number. \u000a\u000a*So many.* \u000a\u000aSeven and sixty years Arlorn had seen; a plethora of summers and countless winters. *How many suns have these eyes watched set?* The Lord of Crow's Nest stirred lightly as Richard gave the weathered hand a slight squeeze. Old eyes blinked open as if hesitant to gaze out of their darkness, but they did all the same. "Jon..." He murmered lightly, "...Jon. Oh, Jon...I dreamed that I was old." \u000a\u000aRichard pursed his lips, but gave a soft nod as his father continued to murmur mutely. Jon Morrigen had been dead for decades, though Arlorn called out for him near every day. *Does he still live in his dreams?* His father blinked again, and - for half a moment - seemed disappointed. "Oh, Richard." He greeted warmly, "I was...dreaming is all...dreaming. I, I think that I need to find Helena." \u000a\u000a"Mother is away," Richard assured him. "Maester Anders is tending to her, she's caught another cold." His eyes wandered to the nearby window, where powdered snow clung to the stone ledge and frosted on the glass. \u000a\u000a"Well, no wonder." He replied, giving a shiver. "Cold...cold like this, in, in, in, in summer? Unheard of...inconceivable...." \u000a\u000a"It's winter, father." \u000a\u000a"Well yes, I know." He stammered, trying to form words. "I, I, I, I need to get Torrance...because Jon...Jon thinks that we're going to Grandview, but Torrance lost the melee there, and, and..." His voice trailed off as he suddenly found interest in some corner of the room. Richard found himself enjoying when his father could regale times of his youth. Sometimes they made sense, and it seemed as though nothing was wrong with the man. Other times - most times - it was nothing more then an incoherent string of sentences that held little or no meaning with each other - a ball of mismatched yarn. \u000a\u000a"He'll be back shortly, I'm sure." He said, trying to calm his father down. Arlorn ceased his stirring for a moment, and his eyes met Richard's with a new found sense of realization. *Does he remember me?*   \u000a\u000a"Torrance." He stated plainly, "Oh, Torrance...mother was worried about you. Said...said, and you were at the melee at Grandview...and Hugh didn't *mean* to..." \u000a\u000aRichard turned as a hand gave a firm squeeze on his shoulder. Maester Anders loomed over the bedside with a heavy head and weary eyes. *He's been tending to father near every day and night...no easy task I am sure.* \u000a\u000a"Now, now, Arlorn." the young Maester began with a smile. "Tell us again about the time you sailed the Sea of Dorne in that storm." \u000a\u000a"Oh, well Torrance, Callidan, and I...we had set out from Nightsong with a galley...rusty old thing...*The Dornishman's Wife*, Torrance...Torrance called her..." He gave a wheezy laugh, not paying any particular attention as Anders pulled a small vial from his robes. He swirled the liquid about before pouring it into a small cup of wine. \u000a\u000a"*The Dornishman's Wife*, did he really?" He replied with a chuckle, though he'd surely heard the story half a hundred times. "And what of that storm?" He gingerly held the cup to Arlorn's lips, urging the liquid forward in small drops. \u000a\u000a"We...we were miles from land," He said between sips, ",and Callidan wished to turn back...but...but Torrance had been so worried that Alyssa would think him craven. He pushed *The Dornishman's Wife* past her limits, the winds....winds blew down on us like the, the, the *Gods* were trying to blow Storm's End down!" He finished the wine, and quickly enough, his eyes began to sag and flutter. "And I told Torrance...told him we had to turn back, but he didn't...didn't want to. Was so worried about Alyssa...*craven*. Didn't want to be a *craven*." \u000a\u000aA moment of lucidity seemed to creep onto the Lord of Crow's Nest's face as he looked from Anders, and then to Richard. "I wish he would have stopped worrying about what others thought. He just wanted to be like Jon, but...but father...father didn't think *anyone* could be like Jon. Not even Torrance." He paused, lips trembling as his throat caught the words. "...and I think that killed him." \u000a\u000aAfter a few more mumbled words, Arlorn Morrigen drifted off to sleep again; to a place where his mind didn't need to torture itself with half remembered truths. *I wonder if he dreams...* \u000a\u000a"Milk of the poppy." Anders stated matter of factly as Arlorn's chest began to rise and fall. "And a bit of Strongwine, all to help him sleep...and dream." Richard passed a hand through his fathers thinning gray hair, remembering how he had once done the same - long, long ago. \u000a\u000a"Does he hurt?" He asked, no more then a child. \u000a\u000a"No." Anders replied softly. "Not while he sleeps." \u000a\u000a*It's not fair. The Gods see fit to put a decent man on this earth, only to torment him in old age.* He ground his teeth as tears formed at the back of his eye. *It's not fucking fair.* \u000a\u000a"M'lord?" A Septa called from the door hesitantly. "M'lord, it's Lady Genna." \u000a\u000aRichard stood, feeling his gut drop like a stone. *Does she know?* He hadn't told her of Forrestwatch...of what had happened there. When he looked into those swirling sapphire eyes, he couldn't bring himself to tell her of the countless babies he'd killed. "What's wrong?" He asked hurriedly. "Where is she?" \u000a\u000a"At the top of the Keep, m'lord."

V**Genna Dondarrion**\u000a\u000aThe chilling winds of the Marcher winter were pushing her back, as if they were trying to keep her from falling down from the edge she was sitting on. \u000a\u000a*Richard is not a Mad Crow. Richard is not a Mad Crow.*\u000a\u000aShe still remembered the day Richard had come back home after Forrestwatch. How, despite the relieved look on his eye when he learnt that all his family had survived the plague, there was something troubling him. Something he had tried to hide from everyone, even from herself. Something that Thoros had said to remind him of 'the ghost of Torrance Morrigen', in his own words.\u000a\u000a*Lies. Richard is not a Mad Crow.*\u000a\u000aBut as much as she had tried to convince herself, she had been unable to. Richard had not been the same since he had returned, and as much as she had tried to get him to tell her what had happened she had not been able to do it.\u000a\u000a*Am I loosing him? Is it me?*\u000a\u000aHearing footsteps behind her, she lazily turned her head around, curious to see who would have come to visit her. Not a lot of people were willing to climb all the stairs that lead up to what had become her private spot, let alone to do it on a cold winter day.

VRichard pulled his cloak tighter about his body as the winter winds fell upon him. The top of the keep was covered in snow, save for a shock of red hair beside the edge. *Genna.* He realized with a sickening feeling. \u000a\u000a"Genna," He called out to her. "Genna what are you doing up here?" 
p3524

V*It's Richard. And he seems normal.* Her eyes slowly scanned the man in front of her, searching for any sign of the Mad Crow she could find, but Richard seemed clean. However, still not sure about him being sane or hiding his insanity, she did not move from the edge.\u000a\u000a"I come here often. To remember how it all ended... or how it all started. Depending on what you want to talk about." \u000a\u000aHer voice sounded monotone, as if she had just asked about the weather, but her sapphire stare was clouded with fear. \u000a\u000a"And you, what are you doing up here?"
p3525

VHe took a ginger step towards her, watching that her feat didn't catch on the slippery ledge. \u000a\u000a"I'd heard you were up here, where...where it all ended." \u000a\u000aHe paused, pursing his lips as he looked to the spot where his uncle had once stood. *Where she stands now...* \u000a\u000a"I'm sorry, Genna." He blurted out, "I'm sorry I haven't listened to you, and I'm sorry I haven't listened to our children, I..." He squeezed his eyes shut, "...I can't sleep...I see them when I sleep..."
p3526
sI5
VRichard opening his heart to her was something new, something that had not happened in months, and that piqued her interest. Fully turning around to face him but without taking any step away from the ledge, Genna stood as tall as her body, weak after days without eating, allowed her to.\u000a\u000a"Them? Who are them?"\u000a\u000a*Is he talking about our children? Or is he talking about someone else?* As much as she tried to keep calm and collected, all the fears and doubts that had grown inside of her saw a chance to come out and she started shouting back at Richard, her eyes full of tears. \u000a\u000a"Who are them? What has happened to you? Please, Richard, tell me. You've never been the same since you left and I cannot take it anymore. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? WHY ARE PEOPLE CALLING YOU TORRANCE? WHY HAVE YOU BEEN TRYING TO AVOID ME, TO LOOK AT ME? STOP IT, PLEASE, IT IS KILLING ME!"

Vthermalilies seem to be having the same issue they had a while back where they wouldn't cool down when exposed to lava during the cooldown state, is this intentional, a bug, or am i just going crazy?  for futher information, we replaced the thermalilies with new ones from NEI, as well as the floodgates used to feed them.

Vare endoflames more powerful? i think i've seen something about using an mfr tree farm and harvester to shear the leaves off of trees, with furnaces to turn the wood to charcoal and feed it all to endoflames and munchdews, how would that work?
p3531
sI2
VEndoflames are far, far more _scalable_. You can stick 48 (49 if you use non-botania fuel dropping, stackable to over 200 layers if you use floating flowers) of them around a single fuel-dropping setup, while number of thermalilies is far more limited and more complicated to automate.\u000a\u000aAny farm works for that, really, not just MFR. Use birches - they don't grow branches. Put munchdews far enough to not cover the entire field (Manaseer Monocle shows the range), so there are saplings to replant the trees. Endoflames produce more power than exoflames require to smelt the coal. You don't need leaf-shearing on the harvester, it'll just require placing them back in the world and I'm not sure the player-placed leaves even work for munchdew.

I've already cried salty tears and had amazing jump for joy victories while still slowly working my level up to ranked matches. I've still got a lot to learn but I'm having the most fun and hype I've had in years. In my mid twenties and couldn't recommend this game more to people, young or old. Actually kicking myself a little for waiting so long to get it. By the way, Blue team is the freshest.

VYep. This doesn't always happen, but it's not uncommon for episodes in the show to inspire people to do things they would otherwise not do.\u000a\u000aOne of the most recent episodes was about the main character (Twilight Sparkle) going to visit old friends that she had left behind when she moved away. In the beginning of the show, Twilight initially is against making friends, but then progresses quite a bit as the show goes on. In the recent episode, Twilight discovered that one of the friends she left behind didn't take it as well as the others, and basically became an alternate Twilight if she had never discovered friendship.\u000a\u000aI've seen a couple people who were inspired by that episode to make up with old friends, or to end ones that weren't working out.

VHas this ever happened to anyone else?\u000a\u000aMy host provider is Devil Dogs Hosting (devildogshosting.com).\u000a\u000aMy server has been using them for more than 6 months now. When I tried to log into my server today, I realized it was down. I found out that the server node that was giving me my shared hosting went down.\u000a\u000aNow, hardware failures DO happen. But I'd expect a professional hosting provider to have failsafes. They didn't back up any of the data. Everything is completely lost.\u000a\u000aAfter speaking with them for a long while, they said they'd compensate me 50% of what I paid in the form of credit (meaning I'd have to continue using their services). They were very reluctant to offer any compensation. They even told me that, because of the ToS, they're not accountable for the problem.\u000a\u000aThis host charges much higher prices than most other hosts. I expected better service from them.\u000a\u000aIs this fair?\u000a\u000aEdit: After asking about the options of where my hosting will be relocated to (from Chicago), this is what they responded with:\u000a\u000a"The server has been hosted by this company since 08/25/2011 I believe and this is the worse thing that has happened or could. Cut me some slack as I am dealing with alot. This is not a huge company sitting around getting rich [my name]. We offer hosting at very affordable rates and I have provided great support."\u000a\u000aApparently, I need to stop asking them questions and just hope for the best.

VI have been mining with a 5770, which at this point is starting to be a little pointless, but it is still profitable.  I bought right at the start of the great bitcoin bubble of april/june, my graphics card died, and I thought I would take advantage and mine some bitcoins while I was at it.\u000a\u000aBut maybe as far as my computer functioning normally, that was a bad move? I also edit movies though, and haven't had much time to do so because of my other job, but have had some time recently and opened up Adobe Premiere, and the frame rate is terrible on the preview window, apparently this is just an ati <-> premiere driver thing that sometimes happens. \u000a\u000aThe solution is I can roll back to the 9.11 drivers, which fixes the problem (I tried and it did)\u000aBut then it seemed like I couldn't mine any longer, since those drivers maybe don't support opencl?\u000a\u000a**I guess my question is** are there any alternative drivers for ATI that support openCL, or is it possible and I am wrong about the old drivers not working with opencl?
p3634

VHey man, I know I blabbered a lot before actually asking a question, but you completely ignored them and then assumed I was an idiot and that it couldn't actually be a complicated problem.\u000a\u000a*Like I said*... It seems to be a ATI <-> Premiere thing with certain drivers. I have done research about this, and lots of people have had the same problem. So I am not surprised that avid works fine, it is a completely different program, it seems as this is just some weird thing that ATI is too lazy to fix. \u000a\u000aAlso, of course I turned off the miner before I open premiere. \u000a\u000aAlso, you are wrong about the 2.1 stream SDK, Using phoenix one can get the best results using 2.4 (I get 220-230mh/s, and my card is on the lower end of its overclocking abilities). \u000a\u000a

Not to mention, you are using a 5770, I mean, c'mon.\u000a\u000aOne also has to factor in the amount of time put towards maintaining the miner, that has a cost as well.

VI realize that I got far too defensive but I can get a bit cranky when I feel some one tries to help without fully comprehending the issue.

Saves them lots of time in the long run, but wastes users time.  I realize my post may not have been as clear about what I have tried/know about the problem as I pretend it is, but I still feel there is enough info there to avoid most of the questions/solutions you offered. \u000a\u000aThat being said i am sincerely sorry for being short and this ridiculously long explication, I just desire that we understand each other. \u000a\u000aYou were the only one who responded to my problem and I appreciate that,  so thank you.

p3638
sI5
VI  guess at this point I am just trying to find an alternative to my current drivers (since newer than 9.1 doesn't work with premiere). \u000a\u000aI can't find details on whether the 9.11 catalyst drivers will work with 2.1 (or later) app sdk for opencl,  or if older versions of the app sdk will work with mining software (what I can find seems to be that you can't). \u000a\u000aOther than that I am just wondering if there are any alternative drivers (like nvidia had "omega" I think it was called)  that would work with opencl. \u000a\u000aIn the end,  it doesn't really matter, as you say i am not making much at this point,  but I was hoping the card might pay for itself (which i guess it has at this point or close ).

VA paper I am reading ("The Gender Wage Gap: Extent, Trends, and Explanations" Blau/Khan) analyzes gender wage gap. Their figure 2 gives "Female to Male Log Wage Ratio," and reports the log ratio as 91.6% in the most current year. If a guy makes $100,000 and the _ratio_ is 91.6% I know how to compute what a woman's pay would be from the ratio. But what about the log ratio.
p3642
sI1
V> You've pointed me in what I think is the right direction, but it's 2 AM where I am and not sure my thinking is accurate.\u000a\u000aIf you exponentiate the average of the logs of the wages you get the same result as it you took the nth root of the product of the wages, and that is the geometric mean, as opposed to the arithmetic mean.\u000a\u000aSo they are comparing the value at a particular percentile with the geometric mean. \u000a\u000aWhat this all means will be discovered later when I've had some sleep and can understand the article I've bookmarked on why you'd use the geo mean.\u000a
p3643
sI2
VI agree! I don't mean to sound too cynical but I imagine that the reason they show geometric mean comparisons is because it looked better or fit their story better. After all, the arithmetic mean is more common and intuitive for most people. In any case, you can't compute the (arithmetic) average wage ratio from that chart. Is this part of an assignment, or were you just curious?
p3644
sI3
VNot a school assignment, but a citizenship 101 self-education -- to try to understand what's going on in the economy.\u000a\u000aLooks like geometric mean is used when the data is fairly diverse in range. I think it's like using the RMS error rather than absolute error -- tends to adjust for outliers.\u000a\u000aWikipedia's treatment for proportional growth https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean#Proportional_growth and social sciences (topic below) indicates that it is sometimes reasonable. \u000a\u000aWhat story do you think they are trying to fit?\u000a\u000a I friend referred me to Robert Samuelson. He uses this argue that the gender gap is low. \u000a\u000aThe way I read it, they are putting bounds on the gap as shown by the data and reasonable adjustments. Samuelson used the lowest number to "prove" his point. But he clearly didn't read the paper -- or he read it and didn't understand it, or he read it and understood it and is distorting its findings.
p3645
sI4
VYeah I think I've changed my mind: after looking through a few more papers on gender wage gaps it looks like reporting mean log differences is actually standard. I do suspect though that the ratio of levels shows a larger gap, since a lot of the "outliers" are going to be men (CEOs, doctors, lawyers, etc.)\u000a\u000aAnyway, although I'm no expert on labor economics, my sense is that the wage gap question does not have a simple, conclusive answer. In fact it's a really complicated question. If your prior is that the gap is caused by institutional discrimination, then the unadjusted gap is the right one to look at because "adjusting" for human capital is just going to difference out the discrimination in the educational sector or at the point of hiring (since they control for occupation in the full specification). And in that case the gap looks pretty high! If, on the other hand, your prior is that the gap is caused largely by differences in preferences (men are more willing to take on high-stress jobs or something), then the adjusted gap is better because women will optimally sort into lower-stress, lower-paying jobs and you want to control for that. My uninformed opinion is that the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.

"Beware the Man of One Study" he says, here http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/12/beware-the-man-of-one-study/\u000a\u000aIn the post, he does a detailed analysis of minimum wage studies, and points in the direction of an answer: look at the distribution of study outcomes rather than just one study.

VI can't find any good pictures of it without stealing them from facebook, but if you look at the front of the pack you'll see a flap that sits above the front pocket, and against your body. There is a sleeve between that flap and the back of the pack with a divider down the middle. You attach your nippers to the built in gear retractors, then slip your hemostats down the sleeve. Keeps them handy and out of the way.

V###Build Help/Ready:\u000a\u000a**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**\u000a\u000aYes.\u000a\u000a**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**\u000a\u000aEverything from gaming (think witcher 3 gaming high end.) to some 3D modeling (not a whole lot, since I'm trying to get back into it), playing with the Unreal Engine a little bit (not a whole lot), some minor video editing and graphic design.

I haven't listed certain things but I just am not too sure such as cpu cooler or specific ram to get etc.  Again for the CPU, motherboard anything you guys think would be better, for example I might do SLI in the future and add a dedicated sound card as well.

However it's been 5 years now and I just think it's time for me to move onto something newer (before shit starts to fail completely and I cannot sell it at all) and also because I've done everything and and asked on other PC forums and it seems like no one can figure this out but my computer tends to randomly blue screen or just freeze at the login screen or right after that.  So I figured I'll keep my current PC at my business because selling the parts individually might not get me 400$ or more unless you think it could which is another question, you guys think it's worth selling the parts individually on ebay?

VThe blood damage goes up with physical attack up gems.... Why?
p3674
sI1
VIt's probably just a gameplay consideration so the Chikage and Bowblade's transformations aren't completely useless, which would be the case if you could only gem for one of them without needing Nourishing Gems.
p3675
sI2
VI feel like that should have been the case, really. Physical gems for their physical portions, Blood gems for their Blood portions. And if you want to use both to reasonable degree, you'd have to use Nourishing gems. Oh well.
p3676
sI3
VThat would make the Trick Modes of both the Chikage and Bowblade effectively completely worthless because of how Imprint Shapes work until you were half way through the Dungeons when no other split damage weapon works this way.\u000a\u000aGetting Blood ATK+ Gems in anything other than Circle is a crapshoot, and getting Physical ATK+ Gems in Circle is even less likely.  You wouldn't actually have a choice unless they made droplets of both far more common, or made the Chikage have "Freeform" Imprints.\u000a\u000aTake the current base Chikage, it would be basically impossible to gem it for Blood Mode with anything other than Nourishing.  Its Trick Mode would be basically completely useless because there would be no way of actually improving the blood damage until half way through the Chalices.
p3677
sI4
V>no other split damage weapon works this way\u000a\u000aNot sure what you mean. Physical/Arcane split damage weapons work this way. It sucks that Arcane builds need to go through chalices for good gems, but I don't see why Bloodtinge weapons should get the luxury of not needing Nourishing gems.
p3678
sI5
VPhysical/Arcane splits don't completely remove the Physical Damage when going into Trick Mode.  Not even the Holy Moonlight Sword completely removes physical damage the way the Chikage does even though I initially expected it would.\u000a\u000aIt would be a different matter if the Chikage or Bowblade worked more like Logarius' Wheel, where going into Trick Mode reduced the physical damage by like 70% and then added the Blood Damage on top of that.\u000a\u000aNo weapon absolutely requires going into the Dungeons just to make its Trick Mode at all useful.  If Blood Damage wasn't increased by Phys UP Gems that would be the case for the Chikage and Bowblade.

VI have had comcast for quite some time and never had this problem. Recently however every other day the internet on multiple or all devices connected via WiFi or direct ethernet connection will lose internet for anywhere from a few seconds to 10 minutes. I originally thought there were too many devices on the WiFi but now I can't even watch videos on Youtube past 240p, upload times are insane (uploading a 40 minute audio only podcast had an aprox. time of 4000 minutes), and I can't stream videos from any other site without constant buffering. The only thing I am not having problems with is Netflix for some reason. Also I cannot watch Twitch streams. What is going on here?\u000a\u000aEDIT: Forgot to mention to me this seems like a data cap but I thought Comcast did away with those at least where I live (Boston, Mass).

p3691
sI2
VTypically the way it's done:\u000a\u000a1.) You confirm the Make/Model/Version,etc\u000a\u000a2.) You go to the Vendors website.. and download the Firmware update (whatever the current version is). It's usually a .BIN file .. but might be ZIP'd. If it is a .ZIP... you should unzip it. \u000a\u000a3.) You open a web-browser and logon to the Routers web-management page. (typically it's http://192.168.1.1/ or http://10.0.0.1/ ... but it varies from vendor to vendor\u000a\u000a4.) Once you get logged in... the current firmware version is usually up in the corner of the page (or on a tab named "Status" or "info"..etc..)\u000a\u000a5.) Somewhere in the web-interface is an "Advanced" or "Admin" area that will allow you to upload the newer firmware and the Router will reboot.

VHello, i've bought an Assimil course, from recommendations on here, and i'm struggling with how to actually use the thing! It's Russian, if that makes any difference.\u000a\u000aIn my book, it has instructions for active and passive phases. I think i understand the passive phase, but after lesson 50, it starts the active phase. I don't actually know what to DO on this phase at all. \u000a\u000aIt also states that during each lesson, it will give me a previous lesson from the passive phase to review. I've looked through every single lesson from 51-100, and can't see a single piece of writing which says "review lesson 5" or something. I'm just wondering if people can give me some real instructions for the second phase, especially what i'm actually supposed to do, and which lesson from the passive phase it will correspond to. It's really confusing!\u000a\u000aThankyou :)

VAre you sure? I was under the impression that (for example) you might review lesson 52 on lesson 74, or lesson 41 on 62. I thought the reviews would correspond to some topics they thought would be useful/relevant to the current lesson to reinforce the material
p3708

p3714
sI3
VWhatever league you're in is fine, I just don't see them as too powerful.  I think the game is rather well balanced at the moment and I'm very eager to see even more fine tuning.\u000a\u000aThe thing to note with the GSL is that a lot of **amazing** players don't get to go to Seoul to compete or even qualify.  The results of the GSL are also heavily swayed by the brackets made in the beginning.  A lot of great Protoss players (or any race for that matter) will lose against a matchup they're not comfortable with, but could pull off the rest of the tournament fine.  Foxer could have won but he relied too much on ending the game quickly, instead of pulling out a more large scale game.  It was a huge gamble.  FruitDealer is the only very, very well-deserved winner in my eyes at the moment.
p3715
sI4
VI sorta agree with you.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHowever, I feel Protoss is still a bit weak. I honestly think something is still missing that needs to be fixed. But then again, I know Blizzard will take their time to make a good patch if they think it's needed. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBesides, in the level at which I play the game, there aren't really balance issues because both players make so many mistakes! 
p3716
sI5
VYeah, I don't there are enough star players for Protoss to make the race see where it shines.  There's not enough love for them by the looks of this season's brackets.\u000a\u000aI also know what you mean as far as level of play goes, I'm no diamond either.  ;P

VHerpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians.\u000a\u000aHerp. Derp.\u000a\u000aIve done some research on schools and am pretty dead-set on the career or degree. My only issue is, i am taking classes to transfer to a UC first. Then the plan from there is finish up at this ideal herpetology degree offering school. \u000a\u000aWhat should I be looking into getting a degree first to make me eligible to go into that grad program? My best assumption is animal science, but i read something other about zoology. \u000a\u000aAlso if there's any herpetologist or even reptile enthusiast out there, what is it you do?\u000a\u000a(Note: Im aware of the many things done with herpetology, i'm just curious on a more in depth view of it.)
p3734
sI1
VWell zoology ive heard is actually rather useless, so it bothered me a bit seeing that was a possible way in the field. After some research im probably going with the biological science m.a. with concentration in herpetology.\u000a\u000aAs far as interests, its been something ive surrounded myself my entire life, studied as a kid and was labeled the weird one because of it. Just figure i have all this knowledge and experience ( caught reptiles and amphibians as a kid and own about 8 animals at the moment) and interest, i might as well do something with it. Any animal im fine with husbandry and so forth. Except for cows... i hate cows. They kick. :l
p3735
sI2
VWhether or not zoology is useless depends on what you want to get out of it.\u000a\u000aMy point is that herpetology is the study of amphibians and reptiles. Study being the key word here. Herpetology is not about catching, keeping or breeding reptiles. It's a science, you study ecology, genetics, evolution, taxonomy and so on. Their primary goal is the study of their chosen field not caring for the animals.\u000a\u000aHerpetology is not a profession by itself. There are biologists and zoologists who are also herpetologists and keep reptiles for their studies. But there is no such thing as a herpetologist who does no research or studies.\u000a\u000aYou seem to confuse a person who knows a lot about caring for reptiles with a herpetologist.
p3736
sI3
VYes, genetics and breeding are also in there and generally common in hobbyist so ive noticed. Huge companies like NERD have herpetologist on site im sure.\u000a\u000aAlso depends if those jobs are available as well, as of late though they may have opened up again, but a few years back i remember those who became that major had to settle for being a highschool teacher and other professions as such. \u000a\u000aAnd no not exactly, im aware that its a study with research in all elements, the entire world of these animals is something ive always loved, and honestly I could sit there studying the behavior of a snake then much rather watch tv. I am more then prepared to work with controlled studies ( GLP, and not) with these animals and would enjoy them. Lab studies and research are my top forte, but other jobs like conservationist, distributors, and even some state work involving herps would also be awesome.\u000a\u000aGuess what im saying is I am aware of what a herpetologist is and what it takes to get that title, but would like to know more in the variety of what the career has to offer, since there is a ton out there. Also for education sake, possible school recommendations and societies who are actual societies and not adoptions groups.  
p3737
sI4
VWell all I'm saying is that you should probably try to match your education to your desired vocation. If you want to work in conservation or distribution involving herps, there might be better degrees for you out there than the ones that focus on academic research.\u000a\u000aLearning how to handle and care for reptiles is not rocket science. If your goal is conservation for example you'll get a lot more mileage out of a degree in that direction while taking care of your herpetology knowledge some other way.
p3738
sI5
VOh for sure. One of the schools im looking at has a program for animal science, which has similar if not almost the same coursework for biological science. If anything changes i could always go into the other, and enter the vet school they offer. Either way i know i have to get those math and science courses done since almost all the degrees require those specific classes.

p3751

VI did it and played around in some graphical intensive games for about half and hour and then I guess the GPU just stopped and went to black on both screens. Had to manually press the power button to shut down. I waited for a bit, turned it back on, screen came on, went back in Afterburner and turned it back down to 0 and locked voltage control.\u000a\u000aDid I fuck up? If so how badly?
p3752
sI4
VIf your computer still works fine, then there is no lasting damage. But there can be if you overdo it.\u000a\u000aYou already have a very fast and quite expensive GPU. Any kind of overclocking can lead to less system stability and crashes. If you overdo it, it can lead to lasting damage where you have to replace your GPU or mainboard.\u000a\u000aIf you really, really want to overclock (which you don't need to), you should read up on it beforehand, watch youtube videos on the topic, perhaps talk to friends who are more experienced there. But are a few measly % performance increase really worth those 400USD/EUR if your GPU is fried?

sI5
VI didn't exactly do it for performance. I heard that overvolting it by about 10-25mv can help fix some coil whine/buzzing I've been having when playing games. At 15mv it didn't really do much but that's as high as I was willing to do.

Then they said that the policy changed a few years ago,  that a letter had gone around and was read to all congregations as an announcement.

VOkay I have some general questions about how things work.\u000a\u000a1: Nodes expel Aura into the surroundings, but is there an upper limit to the amount of combined aura there can be? Or with a node, would the aura it's expelling eventually fill the area? Like if I have a Terra node, will it always, always continue to expel terra or will it stop at a certain point if there's too much combined aura in the area?\u000a\u000a2: How exactly does growing crystals work? If I have that same terra node, and it does indeed stop outputting at a certain point, is that when the crystals grow? The crystals take that overflow in order to grow, and give it back when there's not much of that aura in the area?\u000a\u000a3: Assuming I'm right so far, if I gathered all the taint in the area to 1 chunk, and that chunk was full of taint crystals, would those crystals to an extent absorb the taint from the surroundings in order to grow? Both for the benefit of the taint disappearing, and getting more tainted shards.
p3822
sI1
VSo what is the level of Saturation? Is that meaning about middle on the...I can't remember the name. The scanning thing that shows the levels of aura in the air. Is that about middle in it, or maximum?
p3823
sI2
VNot sure what the actual numbers are, but yes when the bar on the thaumometer is maxed the aura in the chunk is saturated. Keep in mind you need to cycle through each aspect to see what it's levels are. The default view only shows the ratios, not the actual levels.
p3824
sI3
VWouldn't that mean if I left the game open for ages, that eventually every single aura would be completely filled in every area? I mean if they'll continue until it's full...
p3825
sI4
VNo because \u000a\u000a1. only aura changes in chunks that are loaded\u000a\u000a2. as you move away from a node it becomes exponentially slower for chunks to become saturated\u000a\u000aIn TC5 you can create pure nodes by planting silverwood trees. And silverwood trees drop more than 1 sapling on average, so you can farm them.
p3826
sI5
VThen if I just kept only a single chunk loaded in my server then logged off. That would be the only loaded chunk, would that get full?\u000a\u000aEDIT: Maybe it might fill it up faster if it's already emptyish, fill it up slower when it's near full?

VWe currently have a 50" Hitachi plasma and 5.1 surround system (Panasonic SA-PT467, it's a dvd combi thing).\u000a\u000aI'd like to get a proper set up now I know more (this is like 5+ year old stuff). I'm watching out for AV receivers on ebay that'll accept HDMI instead of using the optical output of TV (likely to be downmixing things?).\u000a\u000aI can't afford to get the AVR, speakers, and sub all at once, so I'd like to get a few things at a time. The current speakers are tiny things, so could I get a pair of decent speakers (from the buyers guide) and use those as the front LR speakers? Is the centre channel more important? The Panasonic receiver doesn't appear to use standard plugs for the speakers, but I assume I could slice the cord and join the odd plugs to some new speakers?
p3830

VMy budget would be blown on a receiver, which is why I'm keeping my eye out on eBay and Craigslist. I don't mind it being several years old as long as it has 3 HDMI in and dts-hd. \u000a\u000aI figured some bigger speakers first to continue using the current receiver and get a decent benefit.

p3833

VI've found on Gumtree a 5.1 set with AV receiver for £200. Wharfedale 9.0 speakers, matching centre and sub, Onkyo 507 receiver as well as wires and stands. \u000a\u000aI know the 9.0 aren't ideal for main speakers, and I have my eye on a pair of  9.1 on eBay, but the above system should beat the crap out of the current DVD player (HTiaB?) setup right? \u000a\u000aI'm pushing my budget because it's a complete system that would take me a while to work to otherwise. The speakers and sub seem to justify the price, with a receiver as well. Receiver is only HDMI 1.3a, but it accepts all the DTS-HD MA and Dolby I want.

VI could be wrong; my track record with Marvel isn't great. But I think they are actually parallel universes, in Marvel. I know Earth 616 have had crossovers to others.\u000a\u000aAs for What If, I don't recall any crossovers with the canon. The idea that all the events shown take place in alternate realities is just window dressing. But still, it's the window dressing they chose to go with, and it doesn't really do to just discount it. Word of the creators is "What If"s take place in parallel universes, then that's where they take place.

VTo jump on, I've personally been looking for a reference on something for designing MISO and MIMO controllers for discrete time nonlinear problems with some kind of automatic system identification, as an analytical description of the system isn't feasible.\u000a\u000aSome kind of "non-linear discrete time-varying black box controller design for dummies" would be nice.
p3890
sI2
VFirst, general nonlinear control is challenging, most theory relies on the affine-input form.  Adaptive control is even more challenging and also requires knowledge of the nonlinearity (violating your black box requirement).  \u000a\u000aIf you were to assume a Taylor series, you could get away with adaptive dual control or simultaneous control and identification.  The key names you need are Feldbaum (1960's), Kumar (1980's), Wittenmark (1990's), and Filatov and Unbehauen (they have a new book that is decent).  But this approach is not real-time applicable for large systems.\u000a\u000aYou also have Iterative Learning Control, particularly learning wavelet control (but I do not think this is well developed, but will tick off the black-box portion).  Key names here are Xu and Tan.\u000a\u000aFrom a practical standpoint, I suspect most would recommend applying a neural network for the model, then designing a controller for this model.  I have seen a lot of problems solved going this route, but the literature is so varied that an application specific approach would be better.\u000a\u000aThere is also gain scheduled control/gain scheduled adaptive control.  The later is a fledgling field, but is practical and promising.  The basic gist is that you partition your operating range and switch between different linear adaptive controls.  \u000a\u000aBut for the die hard neophyte: model free control like a PID or intelligent PID.  PID can be found anywhere, but intelligent PID you have Fliess or Levine.\u000a\u000aOther comments/questions because of your flair:\u000a\u000a* Is it that you want a simple model of a PDE?  If so, a common technique is to approximate the PDE by a large number of linear ODEs (and sometimes with a small subset of nonlinear ODEs), then using model order reduction (MOR) techniques on the linear portion of the model to reasonably approximate the input-to-output behavior so that a simple model-based controller can be designed.   There have been some amazing results with MOR applied to PDE systems, I have seen on more than one occasion authors being able to take a PDE, approximate it with something like 10000< nodes, then reduce it to between 4-10 states for real-time control. \u000a\u000a* Have you looked at PDE/adaptive PDE control?  I know it is rarely applicable, but it is still neat. 
p3891
sI3
VI have been looking into reduced order modeling  / dynamic modal decomposition type things but right now they're pretty beyond me, but there seem to be some tools out there to implement them.\u000a\u000aWhat I'm really after is a controller for a handful of input parameters to a numerical method with the objective of driving the feedback (solution error) to 0 as fast as possible. I had fantastic luck in the past utilizing a simple PID to control a single parameter (step size) for iterations on a simpler but related problem which motivates me to do this. On my current problem, I've selected these parameters at the start by casting it as a global optimization on those parameters (realistically maybe 3-4 inputs for 1 maybe 2 outputs) to see what worked best, and that works okay, but I know that far better performance can be had with adapting it as it progresses. From the controls researchers I've talked to, it'd be pretty cutting edge to work out, but has been a pet obsession of mine on the side of my regular research. I need my own damn grad student or to convince some controls researcher to join my cause =)  (sorry to be kinda vague, active research and all that)

VSenior Lieutenant Kevin al'Cair reigned in several hundred paces from the outskirts of the city before him. Large manor houses and inns rose up throughout it, blocking his view of the Manethendrelle. His mount whinnied under him, clearly tired from the long and demanding ride. More tired than he was, even. He ordered the nearest Under-Lieutenant to organize the men, then selected the pair closest to him as guards. They trotted forward towards the gate in the stone wall.\u000a\u000aThe guards at the gate were clearly alert, tensing when they saw his regalia. \u000a\u000a"My name is Kevin al'Cair. I am here on behalf of Lord Captain Commander Niall and Lord Captain Marne to see Lord Correisc."
p3939
sI1
VKevin sat atop his horse, waiting in silence and stillness for the Lord to arrive. He had learned that trick from Lord Marne. Simply concentrate, create a small bubble of nothingness in your mind and expand it until thoughts and emotions skittered across the surface, never coming close to your center. It was easy to wait like this, and the stillness often unnerved others. His mount, excellently trained, also remained as still as a horse could for time with a rider on its back. Behind Kevin, the other Children fidgeted with their reins and checked their swords in their sheaths. \u000a\u000aFinally Lord Correisc approached, greeting them warmly. Far more warmly than any who were not in serious trouble would ever greet the Children, despite their righteous cause. He was clean too, while Kevin was uncomfortably aware of how travel worn his whites were after nineteen days in the saddle, riding hard. The concern pressed on his bubble, threatening to pop it, just barely failing. Regardless, he had a mission to carry out.\u000a\u000a"Lord Correisc," said Kevin, eyes meeting those of the Lord firmly, "I come with two hundred Children of the Light, all prepared to fight against this so called Dragon. I bear with me the compliments of Lord Captain Daerid Marne and the Lord Captain Commander, Pedron Niall. I have been informed that I am to report and answer only to you, My Lord, or whatever man you appoint as your battle leader and second. Now, if I may ask, my men are tired and hungry. Where might they settle in to rest? I don't believe any will be truly ready to fight until tomorrow." \u000a\u000aThere. Probably the way Lord Marne would have handled it. He had a much better way with words than Kevin.

At least he's on our side for now*\u000a \u000a"Of course" he replied, "I imagine you must need some time after such a fast journey. I'm afraid that there is nowhere in the city capable of holding two hundred men at the same time, but feel free to set up camp in the pasture outside the walls, then your men may come and go."\u000a \u000aHearing the creak of a wagon just behind him, Aedan glanced backwards. The baggage train for the meeting with the Alliance of the Northern Lion had begun to leave the city.\u000a \u000a"I hate to appear rude, but you have caught us at a slightly unfortunate time. We were just about to set off North to meet with a force of Murandian and Altaran Lords."\u000a \u000a"More allies against the False Dragon!" added Coll cheerfully.\u000a \u000aAedan smiled, but it was a smile full of worry, "We hope" he added. "We should only be gone for two or three days. Until I return I request that you report to Captain Silas Varnalin, who is in charge of military matters here in Mindea. I will send word to him of your arrival. Your name, by the way?"

I will speak to this Captain Varnalin, and have a look at your city's defenses, determine where my men can best be used against the enemies. By your leave, Lord Correisc."

He hoped the man would prove useful.\u000a \u000a*If not, then I'll make do*\u000a \u000a"Welcome to Mindea, Senior Lieutenant" he began, "I understand you briefly met Lord Aedan before he left to deal with another problem. The Alliance of the Northern Lion, they're calling themselves. Maybe they'll help against Todande, maybe they're just vultures looking to take advantage of a bad situation. Lord Aedan will know when he returns"\u000a \u000aVarnalin gestured al'Cair over to the map he had been looking at, and began to point out the necessary details. "This is Mindea. Currently two thirds of our troops are based here. This spot up river is where the remaining third are camped. Mainly light cavalry, they are scouting up and down the banks of the Manetherendrelle, looking for any sign that Todande is about to try a crossing. The two thirds based in Mindea are also being sent out to scour the countryside for Dragonsworn."\u000a \u000aVarnalin studied the man opposite him. By the state of his clothes he had clearly come straight here as soon as he arrived, but was evidently still able to focus on the information presented to him. *So not completely useless then. That's good* Varnalin thought.\u000a \u000a"We reckon we should have a few days notice of any attempted crossing by Todande and his men. Getting that many men across a river that large can not be done quietly. When that happens we'll make sure that the crossing is as bloody as possible. For the time being rest your men, take four or five days if that's what is needed. When we finally do need your men, I want them in peak condition. Any Questions?"
p3943

VAs he walked in, Kevin sized up the Captain in front of him, bent over a map. Strong, and when he spoke his voice was that of a commander used to being obeyed. Kevin did. A quick survey of the map, and an equally quick analysis of the limited information. "I would like to see a plot of all the known locations of ferries within 5 leagues, on both rivers, especially any that you have allowed to remain active. Have your outer guards been inspecting every man that enters Mindea carefully? And your men, what is the force composition? How many crossbows and archers, pike, horse. We must quickly integrate our forces and allow my men to begin patrols, learn the lay of the land. I would like to move them into accommodations or camp first, and quickly."\u000a\u000aKevin looked up, then faltered slightly. "I am sorry, Captain. I did not mean to act as though I was in control. I recognize you as my commander for the time being." He even saluted briefly, fist to sunburst. "You must know already the Children are primarily heavy horse, though we are well trained in fighting afoot if the need arises. How would you like us utilised?"

So things were going great. \u000a   \u000aAfter several minutes of surfing the channels, finding nothing that struck my interest, I put it on the news and grabbed the book I had been reading from the coffee table, turning to the dog-eared page and sighing as the anchorwoman droned on in the background. I kept catching bits of the news as I turned the pages. "....World Cup bid.....tension building in Middle East.....clean water initiative...." \u000a   \u000aAs I turned the page, the lights flickered. I raised my head, wondering if I'd forgotten to pay the electricity bill, at which point I was plunged into darkness. "Yup....way to go Jane," I said aloud. I sighed, getting up off the couch and slowly, carefully made my way to the kitchen, opening a cabinet and getting out a flash light, clicking it on and moving the beam across the dark, empty apartment. And in the darkness, the silence deafening, I kinda wished I was the social butterfly my parents had wanted. Perhaps then, I wouldn't be standing here alone, food and sweat stains covering my shirt. \u000a   \u000aSeeing as I had no power, I decided it would be best to go out tonight. I went upstairs to my bedroom and tried my best to assemble an outfit in the darkness, the flashlight not providing nearly enough light for me to do my makeup. I hoped and prayed I wouldn't end up looking like a clown as I got ready, putting on what I assumed were blue jeans and a basic white tee shirt. \u000a   \u000aAs I slipped my black and white Chucks on, I begin to hear a sound in my backyard. It was a low sound at first but it got increasingly loud, like some great mechanical beast wheezing. As the sound grew to a crescendo, I looked out the window into the backyard at which point the lone tree in my backyard was blown to smithereens, a flash of blue all I saw before I shielded my eyes. Then all was silent again. \u000a   \u000aI cautiously peeked out the window and saw, of all things, a police box sitting in the remains of the tree, brilliant orange and yellow light pouring out of the windows. I ran downstairs to the patio doors and flashed the beam of the light out onto the police box, smoke coming off of it. I opened the doors and quietly stepped out into the dark. \u000a   \u000a"My god," I said as I surveyed the damage. Branches and leaves lie scattered all around the yard, but I was paying more attention to the box in the tree. The orange and yellow light was no longer pouring out of the windows, but smoke poured out of the crack between the doors. Suddenly, the doors were thrown open and someone fell out, hitting the ground with a groan and a thud. I gasped, flashing my beam on them. It was a man, his clothes in tatters. I frantically fished my phone out of my pocket to dial 911 and frowned as I found it was turned off. "Weird..." I thought. I cautiously stepped towards the man, his short, dark red hair blowing softly in the wind. \u000a"A-are you okay sir?" I asked. He groaned in response. I stepped closer and kneeled, turning him over, shocked to find that despite his clothes being all but destroyed, his face appeared fine. He had a thick red beard, one that hadn't been shaved in several days. His ivory skin was almost too intense to flash the beam of light on. His dark green eyes slowly opened and then, seeing me, they shot open. \u000a   \u000aHe jumped up with surprising dexterity for a man who'd just suffered a terrible crash. He looked at me and then began examining himself, making sure he was uninjured. I stood there frozen, unable to speak. Satisfied that he was okay, the man turned towards the police box in the tree. "You have got to be kidding me," he said in a thick Scottish accent. He turned towards me. "Can you believe this?!" he said incredulously, gesturing to the box. I really couldn't. He sighed. "Well, that's just great." He turned toward me again, his eyes narrowing. "Why do you keep doing that? I don't like it," he said. \u000a   \u000a"Wh-what are you talking about?" I managed to say. \u000a"That blurry thing. You're all fuzzy! It really is very distracting." He turned back towards the box. "Oh, not you too!" he shouted at it. He walked over to me, his long, thin legs carrying him to me in seconds. "I need your car blur person." \u000a"F-for what?" I asked, still not sure if I was dreaming. "Need to get the TARDIS out of the tree." \u000a"T-TARDIS?" \u000a"Oh, for God's sake! Can you manage a single bloody sentence without stammering?!" That made me mad. \u000a"Hey, you're the one who crashed into my backyard," I yelled. He looked surprised at that. \u000a"Backyard? Where are we? When are we?" \u000a"What are you, daft?" I said. "New York City, 2015. \u000a"If we're in New York City in 2015," he said, "then why are there no lights for miles around?" He asked. And for the first time, I noticed that it wasn't just my apartment. The city was dark as far as the eye could see. "My god..." I said. I turned back towards the man, but he wasn't there. I whirled around to see his slender legs disappearing into my open patio doors. I ran after him. "Hey! You can't just barge into people's homes like that!" I said. He seemed to be paying me no attention. He was examining his reflection in the hallway mirror, making cartoonish expressions at himself. \u000a   \u000a"Well, could've been worse I suppose," he said. "Although I wish I wasn't so blurry." He whirled around to me. "So, ready to give me those car keys?" he asked. \u000a   \u000a"Oh no, no way. First of all, I don't even know who you are! Second, you're in no shape to drive. You can't even see clearly!" \u000a   \u000aHe frowned at me and then held up one long, thin finger. "I'm the Doctor." He added another digit, his fingers forming a peace sign. "I suppose you're right. Never actually learned to drive....can you help me?" I stared at him for a second, mulling over whether or not he could be trusted, his emerald eyes staring into mine. \u000a  \u000a"Okay," I finally said. His face lit up. "Great!" he said, walking back towards the patio. "This way" I said, pulling him by the collar. He turned and we exited the apartment.

VNo, this was used by all successful governments. 
p3955
sI2
VDuh.\u000a\u000aThe higher the debt burden, the smaller the economic slowdown or recession an economy can withstand before failing.  When the economy fails, the government is no longer "successful."  See Italy, Greece, and others for recent examples.
p3956
sI3
VWhat you're ignoring there, crucially, is the cause of economic failure. Private debt causes recession. Public debt limits the response.\u000a\u000aI don't see how a country can really get so near to catastrophic private debt without the government also taking on board some debt.\u000a\u000aPerhaps Australia & Norway are the only examples that contradict this.
p3957
sI4
VWhen the news reports on the "European Debt Crisis," they're not talking about private debt.\u000a\u000aCertain European countries ran huge deficits trying to provide for their people in the way their governments saw fit.  When the economic slowdown occurred, their public debt quickly overwhelmed them.  Severe austerity measures were proposed or imposed.  Those measures were resisted by  their people accustomed to getting services for essentially nothing.  Eventually the governments failed.\u000a\u000aPublic debt.
p3958
sI5
VYou're wrong. Debt levels are almost universally high amongst EU governments. Bad borrowing policies were adopted first and most aggressively by the German government after the last round of reforms (over a decade ago).\u000a\u000aThe real problem was the availability of the common currency / borrowing market. It allowed countries that were behind already economically to borrow (their businesses, workers etc.) which saw a rise in wages that outpaced growth. Basically they funded their economic growth with private debt ... and because the government's income was only growing at the same pace as growth, and their expenses were growing with debt enforced inflation their capacity to reign the situation back in was hindered.\u000a\u000aYou seem to be making the age old libertarian vs. social democrat fallacy here. Compare the figures on Spain & Germany if you want proof. Or for that matter Poland & Greece or Sweden & Italy.\u000a\u000aLets stick to Spain / Germany for the sake of conciseness.\u000a\u000aSpain's gov debt went from 71% of GDP in 2000 to 72% in 2010.\u000a\u000aGermany went from 61% to 74% in the same time frame.\u000a\u000aNow for private debt: Spain; 187-283%, Germany 165-164%\u000a\u000aThe fundamental problem is quite simple. Our modern economic situation gives people the 'right' to borrow to maintain their expected growth in income. This flies in the face of real economic conditions ... yet our economists told the public proudly growth was guaranteed. So they simply assumed that as the country and their immediate peers got richer, they could too. So they borrowed ... and paid more for the basics. The basics rose in price. The wages followed and more debt... and more debt.\u000a\u000aNow keep in mind that for 7 of those 10 years Spain had a social democrat party.

VThanks for sharing your view and for pointing out Zizek's critique of Buddhism. I'll definitely check that out. Could you point me to some meaningful texts on Therawada Buddhism? Also, what do you think about philosophy essentially nurturing the ego in contrast with "death of the ego" according to Buddhism?

V> Could you point me to some meaningful texts on Therawada Buddhism\u000a\u000aWalpola Rahula thero's "What Budhdha taught" is a start.

Could you clarify? My experience is the exact opposite.\u000a
p3964
sI3
VSome think that the ego is associated with the mind and philosophy is based on logic (of the mind). Furthermore philosophy covers a vast range of topics and sciences. Thus the philosopher uses the minds logic and accumulates "knowledge" in different fields and in this process the ego grows bigger because the "knowledge" is from the mind and not from the "self".
p3965
sI4
VI can see how it's easy to be an asshole once you have some philosophical knowledge. But when I read Zizek say "At the core of being there is a void" , it was a very beautiful way of putting to words that there is no ultimate "self". Everything we think of as "self" are a socially mediated structure built around this void. When you realize this, there's no point in being egoistic or whatever. (Buddhism says something very close to this though it arrives at the selflessness from the perspective of impermanence)\u000a\u000aAnyway, is it inherently wrong to be egoistic?\u000a
p3966
sI5
VI agree that there is no point in being egoistic or self-centered.\u000aI don't think it's inherently wrong nor inherently good to be egoistic or altruistic for that matter.

VSpecs: Intel Core i7 4790k\u000aASUS: Z97-A ATX Motherboard\u000a8GB Corsair Vengeance DDR3 1600mHz RAM, \u000aSeagate Barracuda 750GB HDD\u000aSandisk 240GB SSD\u000aWindows 8.1 (With Start Is Back)\u000a\u000aAlright so today I managed to pick up a 240GB Sandisk SSD Plus from my local electronics store. I wanted to clone my old HDD to my new SSD so I could avoid having to reinstall Windows and getting back all my old data. So basically I opened up my PC, hooked up the SSD to a SATA 3 port, plugged in the power cables, and turned my PC back on. After installing the SSD, I went into Disk Management and set my new SSD to active. I then used a program called EaseUS Todo Backup and cloned the old HDD to the new SSD. After that process was done, I restarted my PC and went into the BIOS and set the boot priority to the new SSD. Before it actually booted into windows, I got some underscores at the top left corner of my screen. It then booted into windows, but it never actually booted from the new SSD. It booted from the old HDD. I thought it was strange since I set the boot priority to the SSD. I then turned off my PC, disconnected the old HDD completely, and turned it back on. I got into the BIOS, verified that the boot priority was set to the SSD, and then attempted to boot into the SSD. (Which should be an exact copy of the old HDD.) It appeared to be going okay for the first couple seconds. The Windows logo appeared, with the loading circle thing. ( I have no idea what to call that. Whatever appears when windows boots normally I guess.) Except during that little loading screen, I got a bsod telling me that my system needed to be repaired. There was a button that read "press enter to try again." and there was a button that read "press f8 for boot management(or something along those lines)" I pressed both of those keys and nothing really happened. When I would press those buttons the screen would twitch for a moment and then do nothing. It would just stay on that screen. I am currently booted into my old HDD at the moment to type up this thread and I am kind of dumbfounded as to how I can fix this. I don't have the windows repair disk and I don't really know where to go from here. Oh and one other thing. When I look in "My Computer" the new SSD is labeled as a "D" drive and not a "C" drive like the old HDD. I'm not sure if that has anything to do with it but I just need some help getting this up and running. I'd like to use the SSD only and reuse the old HDD for a HTPC or something.
p3986

VOkay so from here what I should do is completely format my SSD and try again?\u000a
p3987
sI2
VPersonally, in that kind of situation I do prefer to start fresh, unless you had tons of software to reinstall and re-setup.\u000ainstalling windows is so quick these days using usb keys, and websites like https://ninite.com/ allows you to reinstall pretty much all the basic softwares very quickly.
p3988
sI3
VAlright so one question. How do I take windows from my HDD, put it on a USB, and use it to install windows on my SSD? I wasn't the one who installed windows on this PC and I don't have any keys/discs or anything.
p3989
sI4
VEasiest way is to use the tool provided by [microsft](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-CA/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media) : be aware it will download the version you need directly from the internet. You need a usb with 5+gb of total space, the usb will be formated in the process so make sure there is nothing of value on it.

VIt's gone very downhill in recent years. It's full of stag and hen (bachelor and bachelorette) parties and the pubs are just the type that pack people in and blare crappy music. The independent cafés and delis are being replaced by fast-food places and the same chain convenience stores that infest the whole city. It's *tacky*.\u000a\u000aThere are still some nice corners and some cool restaurants and cafés have survived, but I'd only really go there during the day. In fact there are good reasons to visit during the day, like the food market in Meeting House Square, or visiting the Gallery of Photography, things like that. But for going out, the other area I mentioned (Camden St to George's St) is closer to the feel of the old Temple Bar. Capel St on the Northside is great too.\u000a\u000aEdit: I see from another post that you're visiting in the summer. You should check out /r/irishtourism for tips!

VI agree the gunpowder would burn. However, if the gun had been out in space long enough it could get very, very cold. If it were put somewhere so it stayed out of the sun, it could get down to only 3 degrees above absolute zero. At these kind of temperatures, the earth-normal properties of metals are no longer guaranteed. Metal shrinks when cold, so tolerances might get looser. Also most metals get more brittle when cold, so springs might not work as well. If the gun is poorly lubricated, contact-welding of the metal parts might occur. On the other hand, a well-lubricated gun might get clogged up, because the oil literally froze and the parts stuck together.\u000a\u000aHas anyone actually taken a gun to orbit... or preferably the moon, cuz I don't want any more space junk flying around than we already have! ... and tried this? I'm curious to know what would actually happen.
p4008
sI2
VOh yeah, that would definitely pose a problem. And the opposite could also pose a risk, leaving it in direct sunlight could potentially cause the gunpowder to spontaneously combust, as well as cooking away lubricating oil. \u000a\u000aI read somewhere that the Soviets actually had a cannon/gun mounted on one of their earliest space stations. They supposedly did fire it once, but only after the crew had evacuated the station and returned to earth.

Three separate gas systems eject the fired cartridge case from the chamber, chamber a fresh round and drive the revolver cylinder and the feed mechanism. To reduce the overall length of the weapon, the feed mechanism is located in front of the revolver cylinder and chambers the cartridges backwards. The ammunition is fed from the right side only and consists of a belt that contains the cartridges in disintegrating belt links.\u000a\u000a- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rikhter_R-23\u000a\u000a!!!!

VLooking for a new laptop and originally one of my criteria was that it had to have a discrete graphics card, but I'm starting to change my mind. I think I wanted one mostly because I have one now in my 5 year old Toshiba so it would feel like a downgrade to get a laptop without one. \u000a\u000aBut thinking about it I realized that I don't play any games on my laptop except minecraft occasionally. The most intensive things I would be doing are Photoshop, After Effects, and large Excel spreadsheets. None of these really benefit from discrete graphics though right? After effects might benefit slightly, but for the work I do I think the integrated graphics should be fine. \u000a\u000aWhat else benefits from discrete graphics besides games? I don't really know how often my GPU is running now or if it's just sitting there idle 90% of the time. What about outputting to HDMI? will integrated graphics be adequate for this?\u000a\u000aIt just feels like I'm downgrading I guess so I'm looking for someone to tell me it's OK to not have a discrete graphics card...

VSo I keep seeing people mention various ways they've interacted with Lisa. My first playthrough during one of the loops (don't remember which but it was before the red lights appeared and after I had the flashlight I believe) -- I went to the front door to check it, turned around and BOOM! Ghost lady is there, makes me jump and scream. My neck breaks and then I wake up in that room again only to find it didn't reset but is continuing on.\u000a\u000aI thought that was a scripted moment during the game but on my next playthrough, it didn't happen there. Instead it was in the middle of the hall (I think) but same result more or less. That second time is when I discovered the bag in the room and thought to observe it.\u000a\u000aI just replayed it tonight to show a friend and...nothing. I was waiting and even turned around when the radio said, would check the doors and then turn around, thinking Lisa would appear but nothing. There was never anything... which was almost spookier.\u000a\u000aBut now I'm seeing all sorts of things --that you can encounter Lisa in the final puzzle. None of the times I've done it has it worked. The only time I've seen her is in the mirror but supposedly you can turn around at various moments such as when you hear her breathing and she'll get you? Hasn't happened to me. I even intentionally turned around and nada.\u000a\u000aI've also read about actually seeing her from a distance and then having her like charge at you? Again -- not once has this ever happened in my playthroughs. I've only ever seen her when she closes the bathroom door early on, when she's broken my neck to the two times it's happened, and in the mirror during the final puzzle. Definitely haven;t seen her from a distance.\u000a\u000aThere have been other odd things. During one of the "red light" loops prior to the "endless hall" with the peephole (I think when doing the from H E L L/HELLO! thing by running back and forth between the phone and exit door, I noticed a figure standing down the initial/clock hallway. At the end. Just standing there. It didn't quite look like Lisa but I assumed it was and that she'd charge at me... Nope. The figure disappeared. It actually reminds me of the figure you see early on after turning right -- you see a mysterious figure standing in the hall and as you approach the lights go off and it disappears. But maybe that figure IS Lisa both times and I'm just a dummy.\u000a\u000aBut yeah... just wondering. Also apparently you can see her out the window once? My first time I tended to check everything a lot but never noticed it. My most recent playthrough I managed to finally see the figure looming in the balcony. Is that the son? It looks like a man and not Lisa though it's very obviously similar in appearance.\u000a\u000aAnyway... just how much is there to this dang teaser??

VActually, I might have a simple solution:\u000a\u000a1. Plug a mic into the contreoller. Go straight for the area with the gouged picture and front door. Wait for the bells to toll and then walk to the phone (look at your feet maybe, that's what I usually do.) It should be about 10 steps which will trigger the FIRST LAUGH.\u000a2. Then immediately go down the first hall with the clock and stand between it and the starting door. Again, look at your feet and perhaps you won't be attacked. Again, not sure if that works but that's how I've won twice now -- only look up when you need to. The haunting will probably be playing. Just wait for it to die down.\u000a3. Continue to wait until a NEW haunting starts. Because of where you're standing -- Lisa should be in the bathroom where she can't get you. Head in there and click R3 to observe the mirror and just wait until you see her during the duration of the haunting. Once she disappears, immediately head back to the clock hall, in between the clock and door, and wait. Eventually the SECOND LAUGH should sound (better to just stand still) -- if it doesn't work, a new haunting will begin and you can repeat this a few times if necessary (I've had to repeat this step my latest playthrough and the last time as well)\u000a4. After you get the SECOND LAUGH -- wait. Don't move just to be safe. The controller should begin to vibrate -- let it finish and wait until you hear the THIRD LAUGH. A haunting will usually begin at this point but the phone will begin to ring. Answer it and then head for the exit door, looking at your feet if it makes you feel better haha. That has worked for me twice now.

Albeit, much slower than her peers. But still positive progress and she was still doing very well. \u000a\u000aPretty stoked as this means she wont be too far behind. As long as she keeps this up, I wont have to cull her from my plans of breeding her to my male het. Going to cross my fingers in hopes that i wont have to change plans and purchase another female. (For any worried folk, slow or terrible feeders just will become pets, here. I dont put stuff down unless it is absolutely necessary *failure to thrive*, and i wont give those animals away because many, in my opinion, are not experienced enough to handle such a picky feeder. ) \u000a\u000aJust wanted to announce that in case any other breeders/keepers are having some picky feeders and in the same or similar situation in helping out a critter.

VThen it may be just mis-care by whichever place you purchased your snake from, which is a common issue since they co-hab snakes and such, which can stress them out and cause them not to eat, they'll regurgitate, etc.\u000a\u000aMake sure you've got a warm and cool side of the tank so your corn can thermo-regulate after eating. You can do that through purchase of a heat mat (20 bucks) that sticks to the bottom of one half of the tank. 80º-85º is right around where the warm side should be, and the humidity is good. Your cool side should be around 70º-78º, the lower part of that being at night when your snake's light is off. The lamp is very important not just for heating, but it also tells your snake whether it's daytime or night time, which will effect his feeding (They hunt at night) as well as his ability to regulate his internal temperature.\u000a\u000aWith this, Some places to hide on both ends of the tank, a water bowl large enough for his whole body to soak in, etc.. Given a month or so for the first shed, The dry looking spots should go away.

Vso I've already thought about: \u000a\u000a* Running a true PR story about any and all cases where he's done bad car repairs (he owns a pepboys type shop, but his own not a franchise). He's done some very poor and unsafe work on peoples cars, and also has ripped them (and me) off.\u000a\u000a* Offering people in the town some small amount of money to tell their horror story getting their car fixed with him and posting them on a website I create, or having them post on business review websites. then promotion it.\u000a\u000a* this guy is a minister, (yes, that's right) so I thought about running a true pr story about what he did (its a long story but basically hes a rotten grandparent who filed for custody of the kids which is bad enough, but also put them at serious risk by voluntarily providing the name and exact address of their biological abusive/rapist dad whos name was not on any birth certificates or any other records. the abusive dad may end up with some kind of custody too if he wants it.) again, this guy is a minister.\u000a\u000a* Sending a PM to all of his facebook friends, explaining exactly what hes done.\u000a\u000a* Posting Memes on my own facebook about him. something like "scumbag grandpop puts his grandkids at risk on purpose"\u000a\u000a* handing out flyers all throughout the town explaining what he's done (or posting on doorknobs).\u000a\u000aI guess that's all I got for now, but seriously please get creative. It doesn't all have to revolve around a PR story. The last thing I want to do is get him more business somehow. Since its illegal to physically hurt him (very very very unfortunately), I need to fight somehow. Any and all suggestions will be considered, thoroughly researched as to their legality, and then acted upon if legal. Thanks in advance!

Ie. no drivers.\u000a- If it has internal storage, it needs to store at least 180,000 points\u000a- It has to do 1Hz recording of the points\u000a- It needs to run off of AA/AAA batteries that can be easily replaced or last for a few days worth of trekking.\u000a- I really, really want one that runs off of the newer MTK II chipset...but if there is absolutely not such a thing that exists I'll go for whatever as long as it has DGPS stuff.\u000a\u000aThanks...maybe someone else has had this problem, and had found a suitable GPS.\u000a\u000aEdit: I found something that would work...[Amod 3080](http://www.amazon.com/AGL3080-Driverless-Windows-Software-included/dp/B000WO6HJW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1272827362&sr=8-1).

I haven\u2019t seen an inexpensive charger that will do them in 3s, and I can\u2019t realistically load-balance among more. I end up using a set of 4 and randomizing, which means I\u2019m slowly ruining the batteries, and they don\u2019t last as long as they should.\u000a\u000aMy workflow is just some Python and shell (free if you want \u2019em) that parses the NMEA and dumps it into a postgres database.

VI have borderline personality disorder, I just wanna get that fact out first.\u000a\u000aSo anyways one month ago, my fiance of over a year broke up with me, and then she beat me. I had to go to the hospital and get stitches on my eyelid and my eye was swollen shut for a good four days. She strangled me so bad my throat was sore for a week, luckily though no serious permanent injuries. She went to jail, charges were filed, and the pre trial is this Wednesday. The first few days emotionally I was handling things ok but boy did that change. I've been suicidal damn near the entire time. I'm so completely devastated and feel completely hopeless. I have no interest in life what so ever and I'm afraid I can't hold on much longer. I don't really have any self esteem or friends and she was literally everything I had. And even though she beat me I can't picture my life without her. In the end the relationship wasn't even good, but I feel like anything, absolutely **ANYTHING** is better than the pain I'm feeling now. I'm 28 and I've never felt worse, ever, and I've been through a lot of stuff. I'm at my wits end, the only support I have is my mom and brother and I know this is exhausting them. I know I need to let go and move on but the thought alone is even more painful than what I'm feeling now. I really thought she was my soul mate. When things were good with us it was the most amazing high no drug could ever come close to matching. I'm desperate, I really just wanna throw in the towel, I really need some help.\u000a\u000a**TL;DR** I can't let go of my abusive ex and it's literally killing me

I'm on disability because of my bpd, I'm in school but I can't go right now because I have no money, I don't have friends, 90% of my time is spent in my room.

p4106

VExcellent breakdown. The only thing missing is: At what point in your timeline does Jesse realize the ricin cigarette is missing? And once he realizes its gone, what does Jesse believe happened to it? From the moment he discovers its missing, does it go:\u000a\u000a- first notices ricin cigartte is missing, believes Walt stole it and used it to poison Brock\u000a\u000a- confronts Walt with a gun, is convinced by Walt that Gus stole it(?)\u000a\u000a**OR**\u000a\u000a- confronts Walt with a gun, is convinced he lost it, and Jesse believes that Gus poisoned Brock in a poisoning unrelated to Jesse's ricin cigarette(?)\u000a\u000a- police tell Jesse that Brock was poisoned by Lilly of the Valley, Jesse now knows Gus didn't poison Brock, Jesse believes he lost the ricin cigarette
p4107
sI2
VHe clearly recognizes he doesn't have the cigarette while he is in the hospital when he is first informed of Brock's poisoning (he frantically searches for it while looking for a regular cigarette to break down the tension of the news).\u000a\u000aAt first, he thinks that SOMEHOW the kid took the ricin (it may have fallen from his pocket while chilling at his gf's house, something like that).\u000a\u000aTrying to figure out backwards what happened, he trusts his guts and reminds Huell handling him before going to meet Saul (the perquisition was really invasive and that was a hint for Jesse's intuition), so he does 2 + 2 and connects Walt with the entire ordeal.\u000a\u000aThe cool factor is that his guts were right the whole damn time and Walt manipulation managed to be so damn brilliant to totally change Jessie's mind about what was really happening!\u000a\u000ai edited the original post, thanks for pointing that out!
p4108

VAwesome, thanks.\u000a\u000aSo after Walt convinces Jesse that Gus poisoned Brock, does Jesse think that his ricin has anything to do with Gus poisoning him? \u000a\u000aOr does he think that he lost his ricin cigarette *and* Gus poisoned Brock on his own, with some other poison? Or am I reading too deep into this?

VCurrently I know c++, java,javascript. I am taking the next step, and leaping, in to more complex things. I have a personal project idea, but it involves something I don't know how to approach. I want to take an image from the internet, and kinda make certain points on it clickable. How do I do this? For example - I pull down a map of the world and I want it to be scalable. If someone clicks a country, I want it to link to a wiki page. The latter part seems trivial, but it's the first part I don't know how to approach. I googled a few things and I couldn't find anything - maybe because I am searching up the wrong terminology?\u000aAny help is appreciated :)
p4134
sI1
VThat sounds about right. I just don't know what you mean when you say polygon/polygon test. Can you explain further?\u000aI know the basics of event handling and GUIs in java if that helps. I'm also wondering if this would be easier to make this app on the phone or a web app? I would consider rails if that is easier. 
p4135
sI2
VA simple way to handle this would be with an [image map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/map) in HTML. A more complex way to handle this would be to use the Google Maps API and overlay data layers on the map. This would cover your "scaling" requirement as well. Still simpler than building your own app from scratch, however.
p4136

VWait a min, I can definitely use the google maps API for this. But if I decided to make this through an app. I can still use APIs right?\u000a

VSo, I'm just starting month 8, so I'm beginning to get a bit uncomfortable and my exhaustion is *extreme*.\u000a\u000aAnd my husband has been out of Prozac.  For a week. He really,  really needs it. He can go several days and be just fine, but when he hits that five day mark, he starts to break down. He gets massive mood swings, freaks out, his anxiety is through the roof, essentially he becomes almost impossible to live with. \u000a\u000aHe's been trying to get his prescription filled for over a week,  but hasn't been able to reach his doctor.  This morning, he finally gets a secretary that told him his doctor moved, giving his patients absolutely no warning.  After a morning of phone calls, he finally got his doctor. The doctor won't see him for **TWO WEEKS**! He needs his medicine now. I don't know how he'll last that long. And what about me? I already don't get the support I need, and with him in this state, I don't know what to dom\u000a\u000aI'm already in the middle of a third trimester freak out. I'm scared, I'm lonely, I feel like I never leave this house, I feel useless because I'm physically incapable of doing the tasks that *must* be done to prepare for Baby. \u000a\u000aI'm not *really* looking for advice, I guess. I'm just venting and commiserating. \u000a\u000aI'm also looking up Family Practices to find him a new doctor.  *sigh*\u000a\u000a**Edit:**\u000a\u000a**His doctor called my husband late this afternoon and called in a 30 day supply at the pharmacy.  He's got an appointment next week and we have medicine on hand.**\u000a\u000aI hope it kicks in soon, because he's in the middle of a massive freak out.

p4142

Vhow would the brightness effect quality? would it make it look better or nah? And also, are the speakers that horrible, most of the time I use headphones, but sometimes its nice just to lean back in my chair without worrying about them
p4151
sI3
VMore brightness is generally better but a 50cd/\u33a1 difference is not going to rock your world. Consider that even the brightest, most expensive monitors top out at around 300cd/\u33a1.\u000a\u000aAs far as speakers, do yourself a favor and spend a little money on a set of 2.1 speakers (that's two speakers plus a small sub) which will be worlds better than the built-in speakers. I used to have an Xbox 360 hooked up to an ASUS monitor with speakers, but because they're so small and set into the frame it's like listening to a concert on your cell phone which someone recorded on a VHS tape. Almost any set of separate speakers will blow them out of the water.

I dont want to over do anything, any suggestions too?\u000a\u000aEdit: Just saw [this](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-S220-Speaker-System-Subwoofer/dp/B000RQSGYO) and [this](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Multimedia-Speakers-Stereo-Subwoofer/dp/B00KK9481I/ref=pd_sim_sbs_147_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=0YXGWNCX6AQ41MRSHW4A), any good?

VWatching the CLG v TSM qualifier match today made me cringe. I mean, jiji has been less and less of a laning force as time has gone on... hasn't been practicing or something, who knows... but he used to be the best player in the game when it came to teamfight decisions, positioning, and calling fights. Now he gets caught out of position and gibbed before anything can happen.\u000a\u000aJust, it bothers me... he's my favorite player and he's gone from arguably the best player in the game on the whole, like he was a year ago, to one of the sloppiest players in the tournament scene. I just wonder if there's something specific getting to him, or if he just doesn't care as much anymore.
p4173
sI1
VIEM kiev qualifiers. CLG vs TSM, both teams already qualified, so they were just playing for seedings in the "real" event. CLG, to put it somewhat crudely, got more or less manhandled.
p4174
sI2
VThanks for your reply. \u000a\u000aIn your opinion from watching, do you believe it was CLG playing terribly, or TSM playing well?
p4175
sI3
Vyeah, well you should be thankful >:{ I wasted 20 seconds of my life on this crap!\u000a\u000aNah, I kid :p Pleasure to help.\u000a\u000aHm... that's very tough to answer actually. I think it was a combination of the two, as useless of an answer as that is? Individually, with the notable exception of bottom lane (hitting that in a second) CLG are roughly equal to TSM's strength in lane/ jungle, perhaps a bit better overall.\u000a\u000aBut that's the issue. TSM's unity has gotten NOTABLY better: They played fantastically together, while CLG really doesn't (notable miscall for team comp, etc.) And, in addition to that, they [CLG] were utterly outclassed bottom lane. Chaox + Xpecial (does not get nearly enough credit) are playing absolutely fantastically, and it shows. Jiji is playing... "okay"... but that's just not enough. \u000a\u000aSo CLG wasn't playing terribly. They are playing in a manner that would be perfectly acceptable, nay, fantastic, a few months ago. But we're not a few months ago, and TSM resoundingly showed that.\u000a\u000aSo: Overall weak play from Jiji/ Elementz possibly (somewhat difficult to judge independent of Jiji, but he was out of place a bit). Play that's not quite up to snuff from the rest of the team. Overall strong individual play by TSM, very scary bottom lane, and just generally good (Please note my usage of GOOD. I still think they suffer in comparison to (offline >.>) Fnatic, and Dignitas to an extent) teamplay by TSM.\u000a\u000aPlease note that all usage of the word "good"/ "bad"/ "okay" is supposed to be relative to the other let's say 10-12 best teams on earth. So yeah :D

VIt seems that lately there's a movement on the Internet and in offline life as well that criticizes everything and everyone that seems to "promote" being skinny among girls. The two main arguments being "young girls are influenced by beauty magazines with their unrealistic beauty / thinness standards and starve themselves to death" and "if a person is fat, it's possible that they can't really do anything about it, so saying that slim is the only standard of beauty is cruel and wrong".\u000a\u000aLet me be clear here: I agree with these arguments (expressed like this). What I don't agree with is the following...\u000a\u000aIt seems that nowadays there's a sort of a reverse shaming, when you have a picture of a slim model and a lot of people start applying those arguments to it, saying that you should instead photograph more "curvy" models. "Stop creating unrealistic standards with these photos". I don't agree with these claims, because:\u000a\u000a1. While it's true that slim isn't the only standard of beauty, it's still *one of the* standards of beauty, so to say. For example, it very well might be someone's personal preference to see girls who are slim instead of curvy. If you make a claim that "curvy is beautiful too", why then can't slim be beautiful, too?\u000a\u000a2. Suppose a girl is just naturally built this way. What can she do? Stop being a model just because this shouldn't be the universal standard for beauty?\u000a\u000a3. If your kids really base their look off something they saw in a magazine... It's your fault as a parent, and not the magazine's. Why should the magazines be responsible for their readers? No one seems to attack car magazines for posting articles like "we road tested this car and it goes to 200 MPH!", claiming that "it's dangerous to promote this, someone will try to do the same and die."\u000a\u000aIt looks like some sort of a double standard, where the tolerance has "gone too far" in a way. Like I said, I agree that many forms and sizes and shapes of female figure are beautiful, but in fighting for the rights of "non-slim" figures the society seems to actually attack the rights of "slim" figures. It's perfectly acceptable for this dialogue to happen: " - She's fat. - Omg you're such a jerk, no she isn't, she is actually normal!", but I can't imagine a dialogue like this happening: " - She's too skinny. - No, this is actually normal and healthy for her, she's built this way."\u000a\u000aAm I missing something here, or has the world really gone this crazy?\u000a\u000a_____\u000a\u000a> *Hello, users of CMV!

V>And part of the movement is widening what is considered a standard of beauty.\u000a\u000aWidening? If the standard is "Skinny = Good", then the opposite must be true, "Fat = Bad". If you try to make "Fat = Good", then the opposite must be true, "Skinny = Bad". Otherwise it's a meaningless standard. OP's problem is with the last part, the "Skinny = Bad" part.
p4257
sI2
VI don't at all see how that's the case. Skinny and fat can both be seen as good. I can like cats and dogs. I can like vanilla and chocolate. We can appreciate people as people, independent of body figure. It just comes down to societal views.
p4258
sI3
VVanilla and chocolate are completely separate, as are cats and dogs. Body fat percentage, however, is a spectrum ranging from emaciated to morbidly obese. If you claim being at one side of the spectrum is good, then you also claim the other side as being bad or at least less good.
p4259
sI4
VYou have given no rationale for that.\u000a\u000aRace is a spectrum. I have friends who are black. I don't hate people who are white (in fact, I am white.)\u000a\u000aSexuality is a spectrum. I have friends who are gay. I also have friends who are bi, and who are stright, so, no, it doesn't work like that.\u000a\u000aGoing back to this "fat" vs "skinny" thing, I have friends who are overweight. I have friends who are underweight. I certainly don't give one group preferential treatment because of their weight. \u000a\u000aWhat I'm talking about is respecting *humanness*. Because I see the value of *humans* I don't have to value a certain subgroup. I think it's to believe humans should judge other based on the context of their groups rather than their characteristics and values as an individual. And so I don't think it's okay that we live in a society where some people are excluded because of something arbitrary like physical appearance.
p4260
sI5
VRace is in no way a spectrum. Black and white, (unlike the RGB colours) are not opposite ends of a spectrum. Where do you put Asians? Indians? Native Americans? Arabs?\u000a\u000aYou don't judge someone based on their sexuality/bodyfat% (that's good!). You don't disapprove of anyone on those spectrums. However, in the topic at hand we ARE talking about judging based on BF%. So these are irrelevant examples.

V**Phil McNulty has written an article that some unpaid, 14-year-old bloggers would be embarrassed by. Here is where he went wrong. Criticisms in bold**\u000a\u000a**Football's mainstream football writers, particularly writers for media outlets that do not solely concentrate on football, are hideously lacking in content, narrative-driven, and amazingly vague.**\u000a\u000aMan Utd: Louis van Gaal is 'arrogant, dominant and honest' \u000a\u000a**Bad grammar here, it should be 'Louis van Gaal: 'arrogant, dominant and honest''. The way Phil has it implies that Man Utd have said this about Louis van Gaal, which they may have, but I cannot find evidence...anywhere.**\u000a\u000aBy Phil McNulty **Who?**\u000a\u000aWhile David Moyes often looked like a man who wondered if he was big enough for Manchester United, **subjective, narrative-driven trash with no insight at all** Louis van Gaal is so unburdened by modesty that he may wonder if Manchester United is big enough for him. **Again, subjective, and slighly hyperbolic. No insight here either.**\u000a\u000aIn a spot of typically measured self-analysis, the 62-year-old, who will assume control at Old Trafford after the Netherlands' World Cup campaign, announced: "I am who I am - confident, arrogant, dominant, honest, hard-working and innovative."\u000aVan Gaal is all of those things and more. If United appeared an ill-fitting suit for Moyes **subjective, narrative-driven trash with no insight at all** then this much-travelled **van Gaal has managed in just three countries - two border each other** and well-decorated coach will regard the "Theatre Of Dreams" as tailor-made for his talent and pedigree.\u000a\u000aAfter emerging as a visionary coach with an emphasis on attacking football and youth development at Ajax in the '90s - he won the Champions League in 1995 - he has had had **two hads, for some reason** a magnetic attraction for the biggest clubs with two spells at Barcelona and another at Bayern Munich **One at AZ too, but it doesn't help prove Phil's point**, who he took to the Champions League final in 2010. \u000a\u000a**The lasts two paragraphs only show Phil McNulty can use google**\u000a\u000aWith United swiftly admitting the Moyes experiment had been an abject failure as a good man and decent manager floundered out of his depth **when did United admit this?**, United have cut to the chase **by employing an interim manager and then waiting until the season has finished**. They have gone short-term with a personality and coach who will apply more of a quick fix and will see Old Trafford as perhaps the final destination on a tour of Europe's elite destinations. **What? Is he saying that Louis van Gaal will leave soon? Based on what? Or is he staying van Gaal will stay? I don't get it. Is he referencing his age?**\u000a\u000aOn almost every level, Van Gaal's appointment represents a significant change from the criteria United applied when bringing in Moyes as successor to Sir Alex Ferguson when he retired after 26 years as manager. **No, no criteria change, United just employed someone who they thought would help them win, as they did with Moyes**\u000a\u000aMoyes often seemed grateful United had come to him. **How did Phil McNulty pick this vibe up? He must have seen him in a press conference and thought 'gosh, he looks as though he is grateful United have come to him** Van Gaal will feel no such awe - indeed he may feel exactly the opposite **Not in awe?**. He will believe it is only right that executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward chose someone of his calibre to undertake the great rebuild. **Phil is presupposing what van Gaal will think for some reason, and also, no strong evidence a great rebuild will take place. Honestly, these last 6 paragraphs could just be summarised as 'I think Louis van Gaal is better suited to the United job**\u000a\u000aStalking the touchline with menace, often carrying a clipboard for added impact **and to write things down, but principly menace and impact**, Van Gaal will not shy away from confrontation - if there are cages to be rattled and egos to be rocked at United he will be very comfortable doing the rocking and rolling.\u000a\u000aManchester City chief executive Ferran Soriano, who worked at one of Van Gaal's former clubs Barcelona, was blunt about his confrontational approach, while at the same time acknowledging his success.\u000a\u000aCommenting in March, Soriano said: "If you treat people badly they remember. One day you make an error and they will kill you. I've seen this in many clubs.\u000a\u000a"Louis van Gaal has been a very good coach in many clubs but his style is very difficult. The same thing happened to him in Barcelona as in Bayern Munich.\u000a"He is very tough, people don't like him but he wins. And one day you won't win - and when you don't win everybody that is angry with you will come back and try to kill you. In the movies this works but in real life it doesn't." **Google, again**\u000a\u000aWhereas Moyes seemed to shy away from making the big decisions **selling your title winning captain is shying away, apparently**, giving a title-winning side a chance out of apparent deference and respect as opposed to making the changes required, Van Gaal will have no hesitation in moving on those he feels no longer serve his purpose. **Seems like Moyes did move players out who he felt no longer served a purpose, to be fair**\u000a\u000aVan Gaal inherits a squad in need of serious renewal. Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand are going and Patrice Evra looks certain to be replaced by Southampton's Luke Shaw at left-back. **no credible evidence of the Shaw deal**\u000a\u000aHe will, finally, be the man to tackle the quality deficit that has existed in Manchester United's midfield for years. The names of Bayern Munich's Toni Kroos and Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus are on the radar, while Dortmund defender Mats Hummels has also been linked. **Only one of those is a midfielder, and he plays in the same position as about 9 other superb midfielders that United have**\u000a\u000aWhat will he make, if anything, of United's £27m midfield misfit Marouane Fellaini when everything he has shown so far marks him down as a questionable inheritance for Van Gaal? **the 'if anything' caveat is not necessary. Van Gaal will have to make something of him, given he will work with van Gaal every day**\u000a\u000aAnd what will become of unfulfilled fringe players such as Nani, Ashley Young and Tom Cleverley? Will Danny Welbeck have a part to play? **Patience, Phil. Patience**\u000a\u000aVan Gaal will happily promote talented youth so Adnan Januzaj can be expected to get the chance to flourish and build on the precocious quality he has already demonstrated. **Moyes was doing a fine job of that any way, but good point. That's one**\u000a\u000aThe appointment appears to be good news for United striker Robin van Persie after an injury-troubled season punctuated by suggestions of an uneasy relationship with Moyes and what seemed a dysfunctional partnership with Wayne Rooney. **Disfunctional in what way?**\u000aVan Gaal is close to Van Persie, who cherishes such a relationship with his managers. He made him captain of the Dutch national team so it would seem certain he will be pivotal to the new Old Trafford era. **Reasonable point, this article is picking up**\u000a\u000aAs a man not known for diplomacy, Van Gaal must tread a fine line in this area. It would be a hazardous occupation to be seen as favouring Van Persie over Rooney **even though you Phil, are the only person to suggest this. In this article**, who could hold his head up high as a player who gave everything for Moyes.\u000aIf Van Gaal is the innovator he believes he is, and his track record suggests, one of his major goals and proving grounds could be to make Van Persie and Rooney a workable football marriage while also finding a role for £37.5m Juan Mata. **Does this require skills of innovation? There are plenty of formations already widespread that could accommodate all three.** \u000a\u000aRyan Giggs, as assistant, provides a link with the past, and someone with experience of how this giant footballing beast works **Probably need to reference Man United here Phil, as people could assume that the giant footballing beast applies to Wayne Rooney**\u000a\u000aBut from United's point of view, this is not an appointment without risk. Van Gaal's combustible personality takes this out of safe territory. **Yep**\u000a\u000aVan Gaal's finest hour was with Ajax in the mid-'90s, although he also took Bayern to the Champions League final four years ago. He has not coached at club level since being sacked by Bayern Munich in 2011. He will, however, undoubtedly have kept his finger on the pulse and will regard the United challenge as his destiny.\u000a\u000aWhen he was linked with a role at Liverpool in 2012 following Kenny Dalglish's sacking he said: "My fingers are itching. I am full of fire and want to work with players."\u000a\u000aHe will get the chance at Manchester United **To work with football players!? At Manchester United!? Get out of here!** The flame still burns inside one of European football's most enduring and charismatic figures - now can he light the touch paper on a new era of Old Trafford success? **Rhetorical question that should have been answered in this article Phil**

VAnd I am speaking of subatomic particles. 
p4308
sI1
VOkay. Have you ever heard of sparticles? They haven't discovered them yet but apparently they are subatomic particles with a higher vibration rate than normal particles. They hope to find them in that fancy new particle collider that the found the higs boson in. From what I understand (regarding string theory), particles can have different vibration rates\u000a\u000aSo if it is just the strong or weak nuclear forces that hold subatomic particles together,  then the answer would be no. The vibration rate of the particle does not affect the strength of the bond (or force) that holds the particles together. Correct?
p4309
sI2
VOooooh you mean strings! That makes more sense. Yes string theory says that there's the "base" unit called a string and when it vibrates at different frequencies it becomes a different particle or it's super symmetry counterpart. Sparticles are the super symmetrical parts. Leptons and sleptons.\u000a\u000aOkay, reading over what you asked again (damn thee booze thou hast drunken me) the forces and the vibration are different things at different level. The forces hold together subatomic particles or show how they decay. The vibration is "smaller" level and determines what particles are being discussed.

Now you may see why I got confused by your question. \u000a\u000aSuper symmetry is a part of string theory which is separate (kind of, it does help explain) from the nuclear strong and nuclear weak force because they operate at different... Levels? Like subatomic and then sub-subatomic (things that make up protons and neutrons like quarks and stuff) then finally string level where the vibration occurs.

VSo yesterday I maxed out my snatch, c&j, and FS, wrapping up that last week of Catalyst's 5-week front squat emphasis cycle.  I am very pleased with the results thus far. \u000a\u000aHere's the video of the lifts, minus the FS: https://youtu.be/iTwtjYHR-Is\u000a\u000aIt increased my FS by roughly 15kilos, from ~120 to a solid 136\u000a\u000amy snatch by 1kilo (probably could've gotten more but I went up 5 kilos after the 1kilo PR) from 85 to 86\u000a\u000amy c&j by 9kilos, from 105 to 114  \u000aMy goal for the Sunshine state games in June was 95/115, so I'm almost there.\u000aA question I do have is, how can I fix my jerk to get my body through the 'window'? I cant seem to knock the habit of catching it slightly in front of my head which really gives me a bad/soft lockout.  I am thinking of switching to power jerks because of this.  I've been playing around with squat jerks for a few weeks and the movement positions my upper body to be in front of the bar, and my lock out is strong. Has anyone switch from split to power/squat and had good results?  I'm guessing it would take some time to catch up and pass my split numbers.\u000a\u000aAny how, any tips and critique for any of my lifts are welcome!\u000a\u000a\u000aEdit: I wont be home until later tonight, I'll check any possible responses then.

VSo I've seen many people complain about the soundtrack. But I've also seen alot less who love it.\u000a\u000aMany say that the soundtrack messed with their awareness, Myself, I found it helped my awareness. The music makes me uneasy as I cross the wasteland of Chernarus, and in being uneasy, I looked around everywhere, and it saved me many times.\u000a\u000aThere was also something about hearing this http://youtu.be/r68uZehZqN8?t=12m56s while watching zombies shamble through a town aimlessly. the slow and steady "Bum shh bum shh" along with the subtle, crackling white noise and ambient synth quietly  singing out at just the right pitches to make my skin crawl. This is what I want to feel in a game like DayZ. Without it, that same effect isn't there.\u000a\u000aWith the music, I feel unsafe, as I should, and am.\u000aWithout, the sounds of nature thriving makes it all feel too somber crossing green fields and full forests.\u000a\u000aBut this is all my opinion. I want to know other's opinions. and I'm asking you please to give a proper opinion, not "Because it sucks" or "Its annoying". Does it make you too uneasy? Does it distract you too much?

VIt's literally a 50:50 split about fresh vs. brackish for F8s, look anywhere and you'l find success stories for both. They spawn in fresh and only travel to brackish in maturity, I plan to start fresh and if/when they're not looking there best I'll slowly go brackish. \u000a\u000aThe majority of F8s are docile, one of the few puffer species that *can* live in a community. At any rate Barbs can outrun any puffer, if the puffer can't catch them he can't shred them!
p4362
sI2
VFigure 8's are ideally kept in brackish conditions in captivity, as this has been found to maximize their lifespan (Up to 15 years in captivity).\u000a\u000aAlthough they are occasionally found freshwater in the wild, they are primarily a brackish species.\u000a\u000aIt **is** one of the most docile and least aggressive puffers, and can successfully be kept in communities with similarly sized non-aggressive brackish species such as mollies, half-beaks, and some gobies. But as with all puffers there is a chance that tankmates will not be tolerated.\u000a\u000aThey are sensitive to Nitrate and nitrites, and need a PH of around 7.8 to 8.3.\u000a\u000aAs puffers go, they're relatively easy. :)

VI have a figure 8 in my small brackish tank along with 4 bumblebee gobies. They do prefer brackish water, but at the low end. My tank is currently around a specific gravity of 1.008, but I'm actually bringing it down to around 1.003 to accommodate a larger variety of brackish-tolerant plants. I'm also planning to move them to a little bit larger tank and add some more tankmates like orange chromides and maybe celebese dwarf rainbows (read mixed accounts of them being brackish, but the tank will have very low salinity).\u000a\u000aFigure 8 puffers are great little fish

VSo I've met this girl online and we really love eachother. We've been skyping every day for 5 months now and we're gonna be seeing eachother very soon.\u000a\u000a3 nights ago we were both really turned on and kinda started doing stuff on cam for eachother, and it felt amazing. Neither of us have had sex before so we're really excited about being able to do it together when we trust eachother so much. \u000a\u000aThing is though, when we were doing this stuff, after a while I started feeling numb in my hands, face and chest. I cannot explain why but it turned me off very fast. I couldn't really feel anything and I started to worry about it which killed it for me.\u000a\u000aI thought it was my breathing at first, and we did stuff again last night so I tried controlling my breath, but I got the same thing and it ended up with me getting turned off again. \u000a\u000aThis really worries me cause I do NOT wanna be like this when I see her. I care for her very much and I've talked to her about this and she wants to know what she can do to help. But at this point I have absolutely NO IDEA why it's happening. It's definitely not her as I am very attracted to her.\u000a\u000aI could really use some help. :(

VIt's OK don't worry. \u000aMaybe.. I mean, we have amazing communication and we talk about everything together. She's very supportive and wants to help me get over it.

p4383
(dp4384

VI try not to fixate on Memantine too much, but every so often (i.e. during periods of crisis) I longingly think of it as the one that got away. There are a handful of accounts on the 'net of people with chronic dysthymia, anhedonia etc. who turned around their lives with the Memantine + stim combo, but the most pertinent to me is a guy on dr-bob who had crippling OCD, was basically vegetative for years, and miraculously experienced remission on Memantine and was able to re-enroll in college. \u000a\u000aI tried the brand-name version (Ebixa) about 7 years ago, but found it overstimulating. I read the overstimulation can pass with time, so later revisited it with a psychiatrist 2 years ago and held on as long as I could, at varying doses, but was still severely anxious for 8 weeks. \u000a\u000aThen I read about a guy on longecity who claimed he had previously experienced increased anxiety on Memantine, but responded to it normally after a course of NSI-189. Not willing to discount anything that might help at this point, I ordered a batch of NSI-189, took for it a month, then crossed my fingers and tried Memantine, but only experienced the overstimulation once again.\u000a\u000aStrangely, the NSI-189 did reverse a bunch of other paradoxical reactions I had been experiencing -- to GABAergics like l-theanine, Neurontin, Z-drugs etc. I had also had trouble with Uridine, but found it calming when taken with NSI-189. Since Uridine is an NMDA antagonist, maybe there is another receptor affinity of Memantine which gives me grief. Likewise, Magnesium L-threonate (I don't know the extent to which it acts via NMDA compared to other forms of magnesium?) induces the same hypervigilance I experience on Memantine, but then settles into an anxiolytic effect after a week or so.\u000a\u000aI guess I feel tired of half-measures. Most psych drugs are intolerable and not worth the side-effects. My doctor is angling to put me on Parnate again, but it only offers me like 50% relief from my symptoms and the insomnia is a nightmare. Otherwise, I flit from noot trial to noot trial as I can afford it, which allows for some  scattered productivity, but I never feel like I have my head above water. \u000a\u000aHas anyone here who responded poorly to Memantine ever found a way around it?
p4385
sI1
VI went as low as about 2.5mg each day. My philosophy is usually that it's better to just rip a band-aid off faster (metaphorically speaking); I mean, if tolerance was going to develop to the stimulation at a low dose, then wouldn't it likewise develop at a therapeutic dose? 
p4386
sI2
VIIRC,   it's half life is around 40 hours thus a very low dose  may be a therapeutic one for some.  Also, 'brain fog' is reported for many starting out. \u000a\u000a If you really  want to try it again,  I would suggest searching for others' suggestions on this reddit on a much slower build up along the lines of no more than one mg every other day for a while building to your own personal sweet spot. It may well be under your old minimum dose or require a month or two to build up.  Otherwise, I'd suggest that you stay away. 
p4387
sI3
VWell, that's reasonable advice. My doctor prescribed me Nortriptyline and mentioned one or two AD options I still have left, including Brintellix. Maybe if I find an AD I can tolerate, it might alter my response/ability to tolerate Memantine.

VShort background: me and my friend want more practical experience in chemistry so have asked our professor if we can perform experiments in our own time (supervised partially by him and technicians). My friend is going to do ethyl ethanoate. We're planning to follow a modified version of the method from an older version of Vogel's Practical Guide. Ethanol, glacial ethanoic acid, sulphuric acid catalyst. Reflux for ~6 hours, using a heating mantle. Various washes. Dry. Distill. I'm just wondering what kind of problems we may encounter interacting with a chemical with such a low flash point, and how we should safely store it. \u000a\u000aRoom temperature for us is probably ~19-21C.

So do all the orbitals upwards have a similar issue like the p vs s orbital where the p orbital has only part of the "dumbbell" shape because part of it is covered by the s orbital?\u000a\u000aIf so, why are we always taught that the p orbital has a dumbbell shape when most of it is already covered by the s orbital?\u000a\u000aThanks in advance for the help

VOhh so they can actually go inside each other. But that's not too common I think? I'm doing inoganic chemistry at a similar level to A levels so I'm not too sure what that graph means though. Could you give a dumbed down variant of that? \u000a\u000aThanks in advance

VBe careful that the fact that 1s and 2s electrons can occupy the same point in space (though not "at the same time", cf. Pauli principle) does *not* mean that 2s electrons also occupy the 1s orbital, in terms of quantum states.
p4440
sI3
VI thought two electrons *can* occupy the same point in space at the same time? The Pauli exclusion principle states that they cannot occupy the same quantum state, however two separate quantum states can occupy the same space. \u000a\u000aFor example, a Helium atom has two electrons in the 1s orbital with opposite spin (because of Pauli). I believe that those electrons are equally likely to exist at any given point within the 1s orbital, and could certainly occupy the same point in a given instance. If this is true, I don't see any reason why any two electrons (no matter their spin) can occupy the same point in space, so long as they are in different (overlapping) orbitals.\u000a\u000aObviously, the chances of this happening are pretty low though.\u000a\u000aIf electrons cannot occupy the same space at the same time, I suspect it is due to electromagnetic forces- not Pauli.
p4441
sI4
V> The Pauli exclusion principle states that they cannot occupy the same quantum state, however two separate quantum states can occupy the same space.\u000a\u000aA point in space (and a spin) is just a particular quantum state for an electron to occupy. Two electrons cannot be at the same point and have the same spin at the same time. It is true, however, that the orbitals occupied by two electrons (even of the same spin) can spatially overlap. But:\u000a\u000a* These orbitals have to be orthogonal (assuming they are real, the integral of their product over space = 0)\u000a* The wave function of the n-electron system has to be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of two electrons. What this means in practice is that if you take two points in space, r1 and r2, and calculate the probability of finding (say) a spin-up electron at r1 and another at r2, this probability goes to zero as you make r1 and r2 closer and closer to each other. \u000a* If you do this for electrons of opposite spins, you will get a non-zero probability. Now, indeed, if you include a treatment of electron interactions and correlations (which goes beyond OP's orbital-filling scheme), you would see a "cusp", or sharp minimum, in the latter probability, at r1=r2.

VHi everyone,\u000a\u000aI spent a fair amount of time here under a different account which I've since (cleverly) lost, and found people to be so supportive.\u000a\u000aI've been struggling especially badly since the start of the year, when I had a very low episode triggered by a combination of exam stress and personal issues (I'm 22).\u000a\u000aRecently I've gone through a breakup which has left me feeling pretty lost. I'm also feeling a little alone generally as I'm graduating from uni this summer and at the moment feel as though I don't have a lot of purpose. I really miss the guy and I'm finding myself very preoccupied with sad thoughts about everything that was and could have been.\u000a\u000aI know it's just a matter of time before the hurt fades, but I'm struggling to get out of bed and keep to my normal level of grooming and stuff...it's especially difficult because I'm living back home now and I feel the need to keep a happy face on as I can't bear the thought of talking to anyone about it.\u000a\u000aI was just wondering if anyone has any motivational things that you use to help you get up and started with the day when you're in a low period? I try to remember the whole 'life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it', which helps a small amount, but in my fog at the moment I'm coming up a bit short on things to help me out.\u000a\u000aAnything would be really appreciated.

I just desperately hate the feeling that I'm wasting away days that could potentially contain some happiness.

VNow season 7 is only a bit in, around 1/4 i''m assuming, but has anyone else noticed that it feels as though the show has gone back to around season 4-esq stories? \u000a\u000aFor me, personally, the show started to get good during season 4 with more mature stories being told, season 5 increased on that, and season 6 was probably one of the best seasons of an animated show i've ever seen. \u000a\u000aSeason 6 was heady, audacious, surreal, metaphoric, incredibly artistically beautiful, telling a long season-long story while including jaw-droppingly beautiful contained episodes (see = jake the brick). \u000a\u000aWhile season 7 seems to have stopped all that. There is no more heady surrealism, there is no more ongoing story, there's just small episodes each one being just random things. Nothing really tugs at the heart strings, nothing is emotionally resonant. \u000a\u000aHell the only ep i'd rewatch this season is probably the marceline/PB ep (stakes not included, that was great).\u000a\u000aI feel this has happened after season 6 drew criticism for being more symbolic, and i was hoping the AT crew wouldn't let the criticism get to them, but i guess they did...\u000a\u000aThe show is fine so far, like season 7 is just alright. It feels too random, the recent episode "crossover" was ridiculously rushed just like the season 6 finale. It came out of no where. There was no build up. \u000a\u000aI hate hating on this show cause it really is the show that got me back into cartoons, and it just sucks seeing it digress so it can pander to the audience instead of challenge them. \u000a\u000aWhy the hell is the lich a one episode villian now? There is no more looming threat, and there hardly is any adventure at the moment. 
p4517
sI1
VNot every episode can be that, i completely agree, you want to spread out the storytelling, just like season 6 did amazingly, with, as i said, some stunning sonnet episodes. \u000a\u000aWhat would i have liked for crossover? "Hey, remember thta thing in season 5? Let me recap and thrust you into it." Like, what? Nothing actually hinted at alternate dimension stuff actually being still active, since we thought it ended in season 5. But i guess not? So lets give them this random device that kills everything and solves everything, which could be interesting if we knew about it before... but nope, lich begone cause we needed this ep to be 11 minutes. \u000a\u000aI just feel like it was there for the sake of being short. Nothing actually got developed from this, nothing changed. It just had a happy ending and that's that. \u000a\u000aI meant that lich was easy-to-kill now, i guess. With this device introduced. \u000a\u000aBut here's the thing, the random filler is just missing its mark this season. As i said, instead of telling challenging material they just do really cliche random exdee humor. That purpoise episode? That pacing was just non-existant. \u000a\u000aMy criticism of season 7 is that it just feels as though they toned this show down to appease the complaints that season 6 wanted to be challenging and fascinating. \u000a\u000aWhat exactly is this show doing better than competing critically acclaimed cartoons? Gravity falls is funnier with a better mystery, Steven universe is more heartfelt with significantly better characters. \u000a\u000aWhat AT developed was its ability to tell symbolic, surrealist, and challenging stories. How dream gunter reflected his true plans through complete symbolism, which was beautiful. How in astral plane Finn is a sperm, how breezy touched on depression and sexual frustration.\u000a\u000aI just haven't been feeling that this season, which sucks cause season 6 felt like such a leap forward, and this season felt like three steps back.

V> I just feel like it was there for the sake of being short. Nothing actually got developed from this, nothing changed. It just had a happy ending and that's that.\u000a\u000aEverything Stays...\u000a\u000aNothing immediately changed. But again, The Lich's hand may play into something\u000a\u000aYour complaint of the filler episode is pretty much describing what a filler episode is...\u000a\u000aAs for the Gravity Falls/Steven Universe points, I disagree but I feel like neither of us will win that argument.\u000a\u000aSeason 6 was experimental. A lot of the fan base (which you have to remember does include kids) did not like the season very much (you and I not included). Season 7 feels a lot like Seasons 4-5, which were critically acclaimed. It would've been a huge mistake to continue in Season 7 what they did in Season 6 considering Season 6 turned a lot of people off from the show
p4519
sI3
VI completely disagree that a filler ep has to be randumb exdee plotless and badly paced. \u000a\u000aEnter = Jermaine, pretty much the highlight of season 6 and most likely my favorite standalone AT has done.\u000a\u000aOr what about Jake the Brick? Won an emmy for how amazing the storytelling and pacing was in this one tiny episode. \u000a\u000aI mean, i'd like to know what you disagree about, whether we win or lose doesn't matter, i just like discussing this stuff. \u000a\u000aYeah that's what i'm saying, i hate that it digressed from its experimental storytelling. While season 5 was a product of season 4's buildup, ending a lot of arcs such as Lemongrab's (and that episode could've been in season 6 due to its crazy symbolistic imagery). \u000a\u000aOnce again, i kinda disagree. I rather have the show end staying unique, than stay on in a cliche and unoriginal manner (see = simpsons). \u000a\u000aThe viewership didn't jump from season 6 either, its not like the viewers are flocking back now that season 7 has a lot of stupid storytelling. 
p4520
sI4
VI'm not saying all filler episodes have to be random and pointless, but having the number we have so far while only being 1/3 into the season seems okay to me.\u000a\u000aI've watched a good amount of episodes of Steven Universe and I just can't get into it. The characters are just so annoying and uninteresting to me. When people say they don't like Adventure Time because they build up stories just to have things go back the way they were, I think of Steven Universe. Very little has actually changed. Like Adventure Time, they foreshadow major events in little ways in multiple episodes. I don't see a difference between the two\u000a\u000aI would not say that Season 7 has Adventure Time on a "cliche and unoriginal" path at all. People just want a pay-off from seasons worth of plots and I get that. But it makes the wait that much better. There are still a number of plots to explore: Maja and the elephant, the backstory to the Mushroom War, Ice King and the crown, Betty, The Lich/Sweet P, the impending future apocalypse, Prismo seems to be getting more involved, the possible threat of GOLB, Jake's mom/dad thing, Finn's mom, how PB built and sustained her kingdom, Finn's origins, Susan Strong, Gunter/Orgalorg. I could go on and on\u000a\u000aI see Season 7 as a mix of Season 6 and 5. Stakes was very symbolic. I think it's too early to write off this season as unoriginal  
p4521
sI5
VI mean steven universe is one of thsoe shows you have to watch in the beginning. Also, kind of a weird complaint for me since it took me 3 seasons of AT to get into it (over 60 episodes), and SU takes around 15-22 episodes to get into it, in my opinion. \u000a\u000aSU's characters are its best part imo, they are absolutely miraculous and fucking amazing. Probably some of the most human characters i've ever seen in ANY tv show. \u000a\u000aSteven universe is much more continuous in its storytelling... also, how exactly has the show not changed? We have learned more about the characters, more about the universe, and the threat is slowly increasing. Things AREN'T back to normal, that's the whole point! haha!\u000a\u000aAlso the show has significantly less filler, with each episode pretty much coming back to actual storyline. Each episode goes into the a certain character, and recently, there hasn't been a filler episode. \u000a\u000aAll these stories need to be answered sooner or later though, and cramming them into a final season would be a shitty fucking idea. I don't want this show to run until season 22, i want it to know when it wants to end. I also want them to systematically start telling a story, atleast one or two story eps every 10 filler eps? \u000a\u000aI don't think stakes was symbolic, which part of it was? It was pretty direct, and hilarious. I liked stakes a lot since it was just a direct story, it had time to pace itself. \u000a\u000aI'm not writing it off, i'm just saying so far it has regressed.

VI am from Oregon and recently divorced. Before filing for divorce (but still seperated) I recieved a check from my medical insurance company that was in my name for a little over $400 that I guess was sent out because the exwife had surgery done and paid out of pocket for a bill the our insurance failed to cover at the time of procedure so they sent a check for reimbursement. She was living in a completely different city at the time and we were seperated. The check came to my house and was soley in my name since i was the primary on the med insurance account. I ended up cashing it for myself. Now that we are divorced she had inquired with the insurance company about the check and they told her i cashed it. now she is saying i owe her that money. in the paperwork for our divorce that has been finalized by a judge states that each individual is responsible for their individual debts and medical expenses accrued since time of seperation (not date of divorce finalized). long story short she called me and said I had to pay her back the amount of the check or she will file a claim with the insurance company and will go after me for it. does she have a leg to stand on? again this is in Oregon, I know laws vary from state to state. any help in this would be much appreciated, cant really afford a lawyer at this point.

Vher father.  but again it was through my insurance and the check had my name only on it.  I could have dropped her off my insurance but was nice and kept her on so she could get her procedure done.  her dad paid all of the deductible but they were supposed to pay me for the montly insurance charge that was being taken out of my paycheck, and they never did but it wasnt a written agreement, just a verbal one.  Does it really matter who paid it?  if the check was only in my name am I legally obligated to pay that check amount back to her dad just because he paid off the original charge.

VYes, it matters. She paid for it (Her parents count as her... she arranged that) and it's her money. It's not yours.

They have to fight alone.\u000a\u000a* Second round: The loser of the first round can ask some other country for help. Imagine that, in the case of Japan being the loser, they are able to communicate with any other country as if they spoke the same language. Anyway, they have to convince that other country to join them.\u000a\u000a* Third round: This time, Japan doesn't appear on the middle of the sea, it appears just between France and Spain. That new version of Japan has access to the Atlantic ocean, and to the Mediterranean sea. Like in this other map:\u000a\u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/w6EPghf.pngPNG\u000a\u000aIs Japan able to conquer an European country from this place? (South of Paris, north of Barcelona, but a little far from both) Assume that they can try to ask for help to any allies they can convince to join them (Japan and the other European country).\u000a

VIn games where I have a body, my body looks tiny. In Live for Speed my arms are tiny and the car is tiny. In Sightline the Chair when I look down at my legs, lift the rift off my face and look at my own legs, the VR knees go about half way down my real legs. Its like im 3 or 4 feet tall.\u000a\u000aAnd as amazing as Half Life 2 is.. the scale looks way off. It feels like i have a giant head on a small body. If i look down at the floor in game, its HIGHER feeling/looking than my own floor, AND IM SITTING DOWN. It should look way below my real floor, not higher. My gun in HL2 appears fairly well in scale to my head, but as soon as i get close to another character, my gun is like the full height as them! It looks huge compared to their bodies.\u000a\u000aAnd before you say it, yes my IPD and height is set correctly in the Oculus config util. My IPD has been measured in many ways, including at an eye glasses place.\u000a\u000aOne thing ive noticed is that when i change my height from 6'1 to 6'0 in the Oculus util, suddenly the table in the demo scene is much larger. It normally looks like a tiny kids table. Why would a 1 inch difference make such a huge difference in perspective?\u000a\u000aI think theres some bugs in this area and Im kind of shocked that I havent seen much talk about this on here. Ive seen the odd person in youtube videos mention it the odd time, but generally its ignored.\u000a\u000aCan we have a discussion about this and others chime in about this topic please?

VI can't instruct you because it differs on every system.  There's a plain text prompt when booting the computer about pressing a key like del or F1.  Somewhere in the CMOS that comes up afterward would be settings for drives and that's how I'd tell if the computer recognizes it is present.  If it's present to the BIOS then you have a Windows issue, if it isn't then it's a hardware issue.

VI mean, I understand that people feel like some innocents got caught up in the anger of the gods, but at the same time, how innocent were they?  I don't think many of us really know the full story and it is my personal opinion that if they were aware of someone unlawfully leaking spoilers, and did nothing about it, they should be punished.\u000a\u000aLeaks suck.  They don't do anything positive for the community other than get us all excited for a day or two, but at what cost?  There are a lot of people who's job is to plan out spoiler season and the marketing campaign for the next set.  There are a lot of sites who benefit from the exclusive spoilers and hits that they get on the articles written for those spoilers.  Also, when a set is spoiled so far in advance, excitement for the set on release is lower and participation in pre-release and release events could suffer, hurting local store owners.  I'm sure there are more implications, but you get the idea.\u000a\u000aAnd I may be off in my analysis, but I feel like judges should be held to a higher standard so I understand them banning judges who were knowledgeable of the leaks and did nothing about it.  Big picture - they want to make sure this doesn't happen again.  I understand that.  If one of my sons does something bad and his brother didn't snitch on him, they're both in trouble.  If you don't hold everyone accountable, then no one has any incentive to help stop stuff like this from happening in the future because, in general, people only care about themselves and don't care about the larger implications.

VDo you have a link to someone who was actually banned's story?

VNo, but if you control+F Level 3 Judge in the main thread, you'll find 2-3 people. Some people don't have that flair on though. I know at least one of them has said unequivocally "We did nothing wrong." So take that what it is worth. I've been in these threads all day, and I haven't seen anything incriminating from people that claim to be the banned party.\u000a\u000aThus, the onus is on Wizards to make me believe them.

VThe fit isn't bad per se, but it isn't optimized.\u000a\u000aThis fit is an intended brawler so while it can reach out to point range you wont be doing any significant damage at that range, as a result the warp disruptor should be changed to a scram to better control your opponent. \u000a\u000aThe cap booster is not strictly necessary. As your not active tanking, nor do you weapons require cap the cap booster can safely be dropped for a second web. Given how everyone wants to fly their winmobile svipuls this is a change that I would personally go for.\u000a\u000aYou have a compact MWD fitted, this can be upgraded to a cold-gas enduring or a restrained. Additionally if you drop the cap booster you can fit a second medium neut to better fight cruisers. This is all assuming you have well trained fitting skills.\u000a\u000aFinally, and this purely personal preference, but I would change the single set of Hammerheads to a set of acolytes and a set of warriors. Given the slow nature of a plated b/c an interceptor or other similar kiting frigate could keep you pointed at ~25-30km. In this circumstance drones are the only reliable way to fight back. If you do choose the stick with the medium drones I would switch to either valkyries or infiltrators.

I usually set the volume on the DX21 to around 25%, if I set it max it would be way too loud. Everything seems fine when doing that.\u000a\u000a\u000aI am not using any adapter on my cable. I purchased this cable today from Guitar Center, it is a single cable with dual 1/4" male on one end and a single 3.5mm male on the opposite end. It looks like this (http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xj746I2QL._SX355_.jpg).\u000a\u000a\u000aI bought my DX21 used a few years ago and have never have it serviced. I know the battery is dead for sure (it wont save patches) and the LCD screen has solid black (goo? lol not sure what it is) around the edges, but apart from that I feel the synth is fully working. I don't travel with it or anything and keep it in a soft case when I'm not using it. I am not keen on electronics or engineering however, so I have no clue. All I know is it plays well and sounds fine on it's own, it's just when recording it I the problem of low volume.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI have set the operator volume to the max value (99) to achieve these results. If I am either the operator volume or the main volume lower then the results are even worse.\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks for the help. I am starting to think maybe my sound card just is not powerful (not sure if right word) to provide the additional gain I need?\u000a
p4608
sI2
VOK. From what you're telling me, it does sound like the output levels on the main outs are too low, and therefore they might need servicing. \u000a\u000aWhat I would suggest is take it to a local music store and see if they will let you plug it into an amp to check the outputs - then at least you can check if they are low or not. If they are, then you need to get it serviced. \u000a\u000aThe other thing to see about - I'm not sure what the impedance level is on the Creative card's input (i.e. what it's electrically designed to accept.) It may not be designed for instrument-level inputs. Since you're getting good signal from the headphone outs, Try a single 1/4" stereo to 3.5mm stereo cable, and record from your headphone outputs (be sure to use low volume at first on both your soundcard input and the DX21 output). If you can find an acceptable level that doesn't sound distorted, that might work. \u000a\u000aThe battery doesn't just save patches, it also saves some system settings, so if the memory goes, it can affect other things as well. I would recommend, if you discover you need to get the outputs serviced, getting that done at the same time.

I borrowed a stereo 1/4" to dual 1/4" adapter from my buddy and have the cable plugged into the headphone output of my DX21 now. I am getting much higher levels and do not notice any distortion, but will have to do some testing. I recorded one of the default presets (Mono Lead) which is not identical but fairly close to a pure sine wave, and looking at the wave recording in Cubase looks very smooth, I don't notice any distortion.\u000a\u000a\u000aI think for now I will use this method. With that being said, do you think that it could be the problem you stated about my outputs needing to be serviced, or is it some sort of compatibility issue between the DX21 and my sound card, in that my sound card likes the signal the headphone jack outputs but dislikes the signal the main outputs send?\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks again!!

VGlad it's working for now. \u000a\u000aFrom what I can tell, presuming there is no problem with the DX21's output transformers, is that it's an impedance mismatch. \u000a\u000aThere's one last thing you can try. In your Creative Labs mixer software / control panel, there's an option to toggle between Microphone or Line In on that input, according to the manual. \u000a\u000aIf it's set to Microphone, try switching it to Line In (with your speakers off and device volume lowered of course!) and see if that clears it up.

VThanks again for all your help. I managed to borrow some hardware from a friend to do some further tests to see what is going on.\u000a\u000a\u000aFirst, a Behringer RX1602 Line Mixer. It has a switch on the back for each input that allows the Operating Level to be set at either +4 dBu or -10 dBV, as well as a level knob on the front that goes up to +15. I connected my DX21 output to the RX1602 input using dual 1/4" on both ends. I then connected the RX1602 output to my sound card via dual 1/4" (RX1602) to 3.5mm (sound card).\u000a\u000aIf I set my DX21 volume (both main and operator) to max, set the operating level on the RX1602 to -10 dBV, and the gain on the RX1602 to +15, the meter on the RX1602 sits at 0dB while playing a single note. When recording it on my computer, it comes in very loud. I set my sound card line in volume to 30% and I am near clipping on the Cubase meter.\u000a\u000aIf I do the same thing but set the Operating Level to +4 dBu, I hit -12db on the RX1602 meter and it records into my computer close to what it does now, fairly quiet. I am very noob at the electrical side of things so I honestly have no clue what exactly the operating level switch is doing.\u000a\u000a\u000aSecond, Numark M4 DJ mixer. Seems to be a standard "no frills" DJ mixer, three channels with gain knob, a volume slider, and three band EQ for each channel. Each channel can be toggled between phono and line. All the inputs/outputs on it are RCA. I plugged my DX21 output (dual 1/4") into one of the channels on the mixer (dual RCA). Then I plugged the mixer record output (dual RCA) to my sound card (3.5mm). Plugged the main mixer output into my speakers.\u000a\u000a\u000aThis is the weird part. I can play my DX21 and it comes out of my speakers fine. However, when I go to the meters in Cubase, as well as the one in Windows, it shows absolutely nothing going in. I have the channel on the mixer set to line, the EQ flat, the gain at max, and the volume slider at max. Yet absolutely nothing is coming into my sound card's line input.\u000a\u000a\u000aAt first I thought it had to be some user error but I have been trying different settings on the mixer and moving around to different channels and nothing is working. I am starting to think it is either one of two things.\u000a\u000a\u000a1) My DX21 just outputs fairly low volume and my sound card has no gain stages on it to boost it any more. "100% Volume" in my sound card settings simply means take everything that is coming in, while lowering it simply reduces volume. There is no way to increase volume past what the sound card is receiving. However, if this is the case, I do not understand why boosting the gain via the Numark M4 mixer is not doing anything and why absolutely nothing comes in from the mixer at all.\u000a\u000a\u000a2) My sound card wants a different impedance than what my DX21 main outputs, as well as the Numark M4 outputs, use. That would explain why the headphones output on my DX21 seems to work better than the main outputs. I have not fully researched what the Operating Level switch on the RX1602 does, but I have a feeling this may have something to do with changing the impedance? Perhaps it switches the impedance on the DX21 main outputs to the one my sound card is looking for?\u000a\u000a\u000aI still do not fully understand impedance, I have mostly been messing around with this hardware and have not done much research yet, but I am going to look into it.\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks again for all your help, let me know if anything I said here reveals the problem further!\u000a\u000a\u000aEDIT: I have had the input set to line in via the sound card software the whole time, so that is not the problem.

VI did this a long time ago to fix my credit.  Pay off all your collections, get legit as far as you know it.  If the collections are unfair or not 100% correct do as following:  Order the Equifax Credit watching service, pull a report, and dispute everything on it, every time you pull and dispute, equifax goes to the people, and forces them to prove their case against you.  If they are not able to prove it, it comes off.  I did around 3 or 4 rounds of this over a year and bumped up my rating 100+ points.  Since I did this and became some what more mature with credit/money/etc I watch my credit like a hawk.  All three are 800+ these days, only dropping because I just purchased a come and credit was pulled a few times, no worries..it will raise after a year.

VThe collections are correct.. I was just really stupid with my finances a few years ago, but now that I am making enough to pay everything off I can take care of it, and hopefully rebuild

VI am not a fan of the credit agencies, and they tend to believe the collectors or other creditors before you.  Collectors are fairly skeezy so even if you pay them off, they may want not report the bills paid, which is why I recommend the route I went.  It is fixing from inside rather then relying on others to do their job (which they wont do).

VI may be misunderstanding how TWSBI nibs work, but I thought that they unscrewed similar to a #6 assembly.

It tends to be the same clients banned across most sites that bother to ban. They're banned for misbehaviour, misreporting of stats, etc. Client versions don't tend to get unbanned, because the problems persist.

VIt's going to be really hard to do that, as the Internet is now a huge, interconnected beast that's really complicated.

p4699

VThe Internet isn't defined by physical boundaries. To sever all links to Russia, you're going to have to isolate the Russian network. But to do that, you're going to need to sever all links between Russia and the other countries. If even one link remains, you're going to be able to connect to Russian servers. If you've ever tried to to a traceroute before, you'll see that the Internet is basically a Union-Find Disjoint Set. 2 servers will be on the same network with nothing more than a tenuous link. And satellite Internet is all that you need to keep a link to the outside world.

VYes, I've seen and used a traceroute before.\u000a\u000aSatellite Internet gets them service, yes, but first, at a greatly reduced speed, and second, it still has to terminate somewhere. In whatever country it terminates in, if the US could identify it as a packet originating from Russia (put all that NSA shit to good use!), insist that the intermediate country drop Russian connections, or lose normal Internet access.\u000a\u000aThis cannot be that hard. There are only so many IP addresses out there, they're not infinite. Set up a firewall block in each country at the major backbone providers, and it would probably take care of a lot of it.

VHi there,\u000a\u000aIt's time for me to retire my old RPi B+.  It's been a great trip, but it's years old and now I think it's time to upgrade.  I've been doing a little research and came across the ODROID hardware.  It's selling point to me was the HEVC GPU support - something the RPi3 lacks currently.\u000a\u000aIt seems that the C1's are fairly well supported with OpenELEC, but I'm having trouble finding some concrete answers about the C2 and it's software compatibility.\u000a\u000aComing from the world of RPi, I've had life really easy - with custom distro's like RaspBMC/OSMC that are super easy to use, and work out of the box.  I'm hoping that OpenELEC is as easy (I used it once, in the early days but it's performance wasn't comparable).\u000a\u000aI'm hoping that someone here, with ODOIRD experience can alleviate my concerns so I can go ahead and buy this beauty..\u000a\u000a* HEVC Support?  Is it really hardware HEVC support in the GPU?  Happy with 1080p HEVC@30p, which is currently the same performance I get from the RPi1 with x264.  Can this be confirmed?\u000a* OS and Kodi support?  As said earlier, OpenELEC looks like they support the C1's - do they also support the C2's yet?  Otherwise, is there a better option?  CentOS or Debian "headless"?  I'm pretty comfortable with Linux so no issues if I have to DIY it a bit.  Just want to know the best software options, provided this will be at a TV with no kb/mouse - just a remote.\u000a* HDMI CEC support?  Currently have this with OSMC/RPi so that I can use the remote that came with the TV for everything.\u000a* HDMI audio passthrough (?) - not sure if this is right, but I'm assuming the C2 will send audio over HDMI?\u000a\u000aThanks guys.  Just want to make sure I am going to buy the right thing, and be aware of possible headaches prior to purchase.
p4711
sI1
VThanks mate. I read a lot of forum posts late last night and there was a LibreELEC 7 post in odroid forums that sounds like it supports almost all of what I want.\u000a\u000aGreat news that those guys built support in this device so quickly.\u000a\u000aI am going to pull the trigger and buy one.
p4712
sI2
Vsounds good, let me know how you like it I might buy one in the not so distant future.
p4713
sI3
VLate reply ... got my Odroid-C2 a while ago, loaded up the LibreElec distro that wrxtasy has been diligently working on and I'm very happy.  1080p HEVC works very well, x264 HD stuff all works well, the interface is very fast (and love that I can use all the other skins, such as Aeon Flux etc).  Audio is sent via HDMI to my TV, and HDMI-CEC worked out of the box also.  It ticks all my boxes.\u000a\u000aOnly thing is it will occasionally freeze, in the GUI.  Maybe it's the skin, maybe it's that I am using it with an SD card, maybe it's something else.  Doesn't bother me that much, but it does bother the missus but oh well .. lol.  Could even be a heat issue?  I haven't looked into it.\u000a\u000aOne other thing is that I had to use a looong delay on Kodi.  It seems most of the time, it brings Kodi up before the network and so Kodi doesn't connect to its library, running on a MySQL server on my LAN.  From fresh boot, even with the Kodi start-up delay of 20s, 80% of the time it will boot up without finding the library DB and I reboot it via the GUI and it comes back fine.\u000a\u000aSome very minor annoyances... Not to say I didn't have similar minor annoyances when I got my original RPi Model A, many years ago running RaspBMC.  When I retired that guy, the software was flawless.  I'm hopeful that the LibreELEC guys will keep working on their Odroid port - it's really some fantastic hardware.

p4718
sI1
VWow, this is great advice. Thank you.\u000a\u000aI had some questions though:\u000a\u000a1. What exactly do you mean with "make sure I have everyone's buy in before I present"? Does this mean you get in touch with these people in a one on one setting before the presentation?\u000a\u000a2. Mind telling me what industry you're in? From what you've described your deals sound very expensive.\u000a\u000a3. Once you've presented your product/service to the decision makers, do you continue probing them for painpoints/problems?
p4719
sI2
VYou bet! I'm in managed IT Services, se we take the place of , or compliment a companies current IT department.  It's paid for on a monthly basis and ranges from $2k to $9k per month depending on the size of the company. If I have to present to multiple decision makers the deal is usually on the higher end. \u000a\u000aTo get everyone's buy in I meet with them in a one on one setting before the presentation.  My sales cycles usually consist of 3 meetings.  1.) An initial meeting where my challenge is to close on the Discovery meeting.  2.) the Discovery meeting where a senior network engineer will perform a network assessment on their current environment.  While that is going on I meet with the CEO and anyone else that will be involved.  I interview each of them for about 15 minutes.  That's where I get ALL  of my pain points.  When it's time to present I'm done probing for pain points.\u000a\u000a3.) the Presentation.  It's usually a PowerPoint of 8 to 10 slides. Each slide has information about the benefits of my solution, but I do not read the slides. I script it in advance, and talk about the issues that I discovered in the previous meeting.  For example my first slide list some benefits of our solution regarding out ticketing system and some other stuff.  All bullet points.  But what I talk about is how they currently get support. I walk them through their process as it was explained to me. Then I describe to them how the same situation would play out if they had out solution.  Same idea for every other slide.  My speech is about what they told me during the discovery meeting.  If I discovered that they went completely down for a couple days last year I'm going to talk about it during my back up and recovery slide.  I'm also going to highlight it again in my Excessive Spending slide.  But on that one I'm going to relate that downtime to actual $ amounts.  \u000a\u000aOh yeah I forgot to mention that right before I present I go around the table and ask the people in attendance to remind of some of the things that we talked about in our last meeting.  If there's a a white board available I right them all down.  I already know what they told me.  I just want them to remember as well.  That's how you get their buy in.  When the solution is related directly back to the issues that they personally have faced.
p4720
sI3
VHey I work in the similar area, could use some tips as I always get stuck with IT managers not taking me up the chain. It makes my sales less predictable. How do you gain access with out pissing the IT manager off as your going over their head?\u000a  \u000a  When you book that first appointment do you set the expectation you will be engaging with snr management? Thats the only way I can think of where you will encounter less resistance rather then asking for a C-level meeting mid process?
p4721
sI4
VGood question and a tricky situation.  I've gone about it a couple different ways over the years.  I almost never reach out to the IT manager from the start.  I always try to go higher right from the jump.  If the IT manager is involved I avoid talking about Managed Services with them.  They almost always see it as a threat.  I'm the guy trying to replace them.  That's usually not necessarily true because MS can supplement what they're doing and still save money.  So if the IT manager is involved I focus on project work.  That will lead to the MS conversation.  \u000a\u000aIf the IT manager is influential, but NOT a DM I don't bother talking to them at all at first.  I aim higher.

Jon will most likely be brought back from the dead and even though the Hound wasn't resurrected (if he's still alive), it will feel that way to the audience.

VSo with the addition of Cano, the M's are left with a lot of middle infielders (Cano, Bloomquist, Franklin, Miller, Triunfel), but lost a lot of sluggers (Morse, Morales, Ibañez, Bay, Guti). We obviously need help at catcher (Zunino is good, but Sucre?), and the outfield is a bit thin (Ackley, Saunders, Peguero, Almonte). We have a lot of young pitching talent (Walker, Paxton, Maurer(arguably), Ramirez, maybe Hultzen someday). What moves do we need to make, and what do you realistically see us making?

VGardner only has one year left, so he would have to be willing to sign an extension.

And im wondering what it would take to get Jose Bautista... would be a great add. NO thanks on Soriano, Cruz, Morse or Reynolds. Yes on Colon! yes on jimenez.

VWhy do you not like Soriano? It's a 1 year, $5 million commitment for a player that shouldn't cost much prospect wise. He's coming off a 2.9 win season and a 3.7 win season. Plus he plays a fairly solid left field.

VI never really dove into Sorianos stats, i was always under the impression that he was a well below outfielder especially due to his age.

Your gonna get more pop outta Alfanso but a better obp outta saunders. If you get Soriano for nothing i guess he wouldnt be the worst to have in Lf... \u000a\u000aedit: i know he hit allright in Chicago, just gotta wonder how his bat declines in safeco... just my thoughts though.

VI'm going to launch something big at my players soon, and I just know that one of the player will try and rodeo that enemy. That is, climb up on its back and strike at its neck. And I certainly don't wish to say no, even if its not supported by the rules in a good way. How would /r/Pathfinder_RPG handle this?
p4812
sI1
VThis is exactly what I like about RPGs; the fact that you are only limited by your imagination and that of the GM.\u000a\u000aLast saturday I played the adventure in the Beginners Box together with a group of four friends. I had only played one session of DnD and they had no experience with tabletop rpgs whatsoever. They tried a lot of things that were not described in the GM guide at all, asking questions that did not have an answer yet, etc. Trying to come up with stuff and not sounding like your are pulling everything out of your ass is massive fun, but also not very easy. This friday, we are going to have our second session. The players are hooked! I'm really looking forward to it too.\u000a\u000aI've used some bonus material from Paizo (Raven's Watch) to construct a second adventure, and I'm trying to slowly introduce some stuff (traps, skill checks) such that I don't have to ask them if they 'might want to look around a bit'. Do you have any tips on how to handle such situations and how to improve roleplaying? We're all noobs so any quick tips would be really helpful.
p4813
sI2
VKeep on doing as you are doing. It's the right way.\u000a\u000aAs you learn more rules, introduce them, but warn your players before the session especially if there are any clashes with previous rulings. Read up about Perception checks. \u000a\u000aGive us an example of the things they asked to do. As new players they may well ask odd questions because they don't know the limits of their characters' powers.
p4814
sI3
VWell, in the first adventure, there is a room with a bunch of goblins in it. There is a boss goblin, who has covered his ears, and four goblins arguing.\u000a\u000aSince they could hear the arguing coming out of the room, and the fact that it were goblins, the rogue decided to use their sneak skill to take a look around the corner, where he had partial cover. I looked up the perception score of the goblins and rolled perception checks opposing the rogue's sneak check and the goblins failed in noticing the rogue.\u000a\u000aHe was too chicken to sneak up to them and attack and they send in a fighter normally, which triggered a story encounter. I don't know what would have happened if he decided to sneak in. How would that work? The goblins were not really paying attention, but I guess that just sneaking around in plain sight is also not allowed.\u000a\u000aEdit: Also, the beginners box does not really mention this, but as far as I understand perception checks agains stealth checks are done automatically in secret by the GM. Is this correct? Other perception checks (looking for clues, inspecting strange markings, etc) are done by the PCs.
p4815
sI4
VSimply, the rogue would have had a surprise round.\u000a\u000a>Surprise\u000a\u000a>When a combat starts, if you are not aware of your opponents and they are aware of you, you're surprised.\u000a\u000a>Determining Awareness\u000a\u000a>Sometimes all the combatants on a side are aware of their opponents, sometimes none are, and sometimes only some of them are. Sometimes a few combatants on each side are aware and the other combatants on each side are unaware.\u000a\u000a>Determining awareness may call for Perception checks or other checks.\u000a\u000a>The Surprise Round\u000a\u000a>If some but not all of the combatants are aware of their opponents, a surprise round happens before regular rounds begin. In initiative order (highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware of their opponents each take a standard or move action during the surprise round. You can also take free actions during the surprise round. If no one or everyone is surprised, no surprise round occurs.\u000a\u000a>Unaware Combatants\u000a\u000a>Combatants who are unaware at the start of battle don't get to act in the surprise round. Unaware combatants are flat-footed because they have not acted yet, so they lose any Dexterity bonus to AC.\u000a\u000aThis means the Rogue would have had an opportunity to use his Sneak Attack on one of the Goblins. \u000a\u000aWith all the Goblins deaf or arguing there is a fair call for the Fighter getting the surprise round anyway with the rest of the party. The party was all aware, the Goblins weren't. It's different if the Fighter ran in alone (rather odd tactics if so).\u000a\u000aEDIT: You are using the Beginner Box, I don't know if things like Surprise Rounds are in those rules.

V*After Dustin and Ulrich's encounter with the bear last night, we decided it would be best to set up the rest of our rather small camp and head off to sleep. The setup didn't take very long, as we didn't have much to set up. A pile of logs in a hole as a fireplace, and our tents. Even though I was sleeping on top of the bedroll and not inside of it, the temperature was still quite warm. I couldn't fall asleep until a good hour or so after Magnus went down, and I felt it in the morning.*\u000a\u000a*I'm waken up by a single sliver of sunlight piercing through a finger-sized hole in my tent, hitting me right in the eye. Perfect angle. Covering my face with my hands, I roll over onto my side, making no attempt to wake myself up. I'm not hearing any noise from the other tents, so they're probably not awake yet. After another five minutes or so of laying there, I let out a soft groan as I pull myself to my feet, and put on some clothes before stepping out of my tent. I didn't get very much sleep, and so I'm groggy as all Hell. Not much to do here other than... nothing. Maybe fall back to sleep. I don't really want to go anywhere without telling the others I'm going, lest they think I've been stolen in the night by something.*\u000a\u000a*I decide the best course of action is to at least see if either Ulrich or Dustin are awake yet. I don't want to be popping into their tents in case they aren't dressed or anything, so I approach Dustin's tent, wondering if I should just call for him, or kick his tent in, or anything else. I end up just asking aloud if he's awake.*

VDon't fall, now.\u000a\u000a*I pat him once on the back, as if I'm about to push him. I don't actually push him, because I don't think I could save him if I did, although it would be funny. I chuckle to myself for a short moment, and sit beside him.*\u000a\u000aAnyways, what do we do today? I can't think of much, myself. I mean, aside from dumping water on Ulrich while he's sleeping.

You want to climb a mountain?\u000a\u000a*I sigh at the thought. I'm not against climbing a mountain, I just don't know if I could. Dustin is a lot more fit than I; he can probably handle it.  I'd probably pass out or fall down a cliff midway up the mountain.*\u000a\u000aUh.... sure. I mean, only if you want to. I was thinking of going for a swim somewhere; it's pretty hot out.

VIn the bay? Last time I went swimming in the bay, there were slaughterfish. That may have been my own fault, though...\u000a\u000a*I give a quick sigh and look over at Dustin.

VHi,\u000a\u000aThis is a little hard to explain, but I'll do my best to keep it simple.\u000a\u000aExchange Servers - Roles - Site\u000aEXCH01 - MBX/HUB/CAS - Site1\u000aEXCH02 - FSW/HUB/CAS - Site1\u000aEXCH03 - MBX/HUB/CAS - Site2\u000a\u000aWe are planning on moving EXCH01 and EXCH02 to a new datacenter, "Site3." I have already moved the FSW (EXCH02). I'm already aware of the DNS changes that need to made during the move as well as the firewall rules, my main concern is the Outlook users. Each of the Exchange servers are a member of the same CAS Array. Does that mean if I properly take down EXCH01 (the first mailbox server) by switching the owner of the database to the second mailbox server, EXCH03, and stopping replication, users using Outlook will still have connectivity? Does Outlook look towards the CAS Array for it's information on what mailbox servers to connect to?\u000a\u000aI'm sorry in advance if this is confusing or was not explained very well. I wanted to keep my question very simple to avoid unneeded complexity.\u000a\u000aThanks

VThank you. This was very helpful.\u000a\u000aTo make sure I understand correctly. If I run the following command:\u000a\u000aGet-MailboxDatabase | ft name,rpccl* -AutoSize\u000a\u000aI receive this output.\u000a\u000aName           RpcClientAccessServer\u000a----           ---------------------\u000aDB1            outlook.domain.com\u000aDB2            outlook.domain.com\u000a\u000aThe RpcClientAccessServer is the actual DNS name that Outlook clients use as a mailbox server. Because we don't have any load balancers, if I were to change this to point to the second mailbox server EXCH03, Outlook should still function during the move?
p4895
sI2
VEven if you change it, Outlook will continue to connect to the old name as long as it is reachable & accepting RPC comms. 
p4896

VDoesn't the RpcClientAccessServer point to a DNS entry or am I misunderstanding?

VFirst off before you start freaking out this is not a knock on Dylan. Yes, he had a bad game, but I am not saying he should not start.\u000a\u000aWhat I am saying is now that we are sitting at 2 losses and will likely have 3 more (Auburn, UF, Clemson) if not more it is time to start getting people ready for next year. I understand during these first games they have all been close and the opportunity has not occurred. However, now that SEC East is pretty much a pipe dream need to do some roster management.\u000a\u000aI think you have to play Mitch or whoever you think the QB of the future is for 2-4 series a game. We can not go into next year with no QBs on the roster who have not taken a meaningful snap.
p4909
sI1
VTrue. Watson looks like the real deal up at Clemson. He is gonna be a pain to deal with for four years. \u000a\u000aWe had Dylan ready due to all the times he filled in for shaw during the past 4 years when he was hurt. But now we gotta look towards next year. 
p4910

VI remember hearing the same thing about Tajh. 
p4911
sI3
VI remember that too. Watson will unfortunately have more experience than Boyd did the first time he faced us.
p4912
sI4
VI'm not really worried about it honestly. We have several games to focus on before we even face Clemson who I don't believe should even be on a pedestal. 
p4913
sI5
VI'm far more worried about Auburn and Florida, and probably Tennessee. We *have* to win those games to have a decent finish. We seem to have Clemson's number. Remember that Dylan already has a complete game defeat of them under his belt, and we won fairly easily. \u000a\u000aOur D looked good for the middle 2 quarters, that's our biggest weakness. We should be making more use of our outstanding running game, and throw more middle length passes. Dylan gets too greedy, and I cannot figure out Spurrier's play calls sometimes. \u000a\u000aThe D did show much improvement this game, over a good Mizzou passing game. We *should* have had 3 interceptions. But the penalties killed us, as did a couple of big plays. As always, the Gamecocks are *almost* a great team. \u000a\u000aAnd for the **100th** time, WHY do we go to the shotgun in critical short yardage situations? It worked a couple of times, but has failed miserably for the past few seasons! \u000a\u000aI agreed with Spurrier going for it on 4th near midfield at the beginning, he just called a stupid play. You should be able to get 1 yard about 90% or more of the time. We are only about 40%, if that. Simply run Davis or Wilds to the left, or Davis from under center letting him pick his hole. \u000a\u000aWard is doing something wrong. We have shown some improvement, but we still can't tackle for shit. The new pass coverage is better, but with the guys we have, we shouldn't be sitting at the bottom of the SEC in nearly every single defensive stat. \u000a\u000aAnd what's with the "best O line in USC history"? They said at the beginning of the A&M game that we may have the best line in football. But we're getting no protection for the QB, and running up the middle depends on Davis just pushing his way through defenders - Wilds seems to do well up the middle when the opposing D gets tired, though. I'm thinking that Wilds should get more snaps, not just in the second half. We should be rotating him and Davis out throughout the game - maybe even give Shon Carson a few runs, using more options, reverses, and wildcats to mix it up, short passes to Pharaoh and Nick and Busta, and teach Shaq how to stop dropping passes. I think we used play action once, and it worked brilliantly, but never went back to it. \u000a\u000aWe're playing 90's era offense, and the teams that are winning are doing things we should pay attention to. \u000a\u000aAt least we have been a 2nd half team in other seasons, getting better after playing the first half of the schedule really sloppily.

I just bought a 200bf bundle for .55$ a bf, and that would make half a dozen of those.

VHey guys. You're my only hope. I recently upgraded from a r9 280 to an evga 980 and so far i've had nothing but issues. \u000a\u000aFirst thing i did was uninstall AMD drivers and ran guru3d's software to clean it up. Then i installed drivers for the 980. \u000a\u000aMy issue is horrible FPS. Whether it's Dayz, league, Witcher3 its all the same. Can't break 60fps and stuttering around 30-60. The choppiness makes it near impossible to play where i could get a solid 50 on high/med on Witcher and 140+ on Lol maxed out. Farcry 4 was around 40 on high as well. (Didnt try on the 980 but wanting to show that it could handle anything decently before)\u000a I have tried a few things. \u000a\u000a* Installed a fresh copy of windows\u000a* on latest drivers\u000a* temps are fine across the board\u000a* set windows 8 power settings to max performance\u000a* set Gforce xperience to max performance mode *tried every possible setting combo in games *(vsync, hairworks, low/med/high settings and its all the same) *experimenting with pcie lane latency (low high, mainly for giggles and shits)\u000a\u000aI have ran MSI afterburner and it seems to be staying around 50% GPU usage while attempting to play the Witcher and the same with League. Temps sit around 50C. \u000a\u000aI considered it possibly being a bottleneck but i doubt it since the 280 was able to handle it so well, and since my CPU isn't super outdated yet. Maybe it's still an issue.\u000a\u000aIm stumped and it's making me sad. \u000a\u000a* Specs:\u000a*  Intel core i5 4670k@ 3.4GHz Nvidia EVGA GTX980 Superclocked on newest drivers\u000a*  MSI z87-G45\u000a*  600W PSU\u000a* 12gb DDR3\u000a*  Samsung EVO 250gig (windows/witcher installed)\u000a*  WD 2tb\u000a*  WD 320GB\u000a*  Windows 8.1 Pro\u000a\u000aYes my HDMI cable is plugged into the card. :p\u000a\u000aAnything you can offer would be amazing.

VHey guys, i'm just looking around for a decent logo designer to help me edit my currently noobish logo into something more enhanced (possibly 3D) for my new channel [The Nexus Heroes](https://www.youtube.com/TheNexusHeroes).\u000a\u000aOnce I have a good looking logo, i'll upload my first video.\u000aHere is my [HoN channel](https://www.youtube.com/iamsyther) just in case you are wondering what i'll be doing on my new channel once Heroes develops more.\u000a\u000aGive me some Ideas of what you would like to see as well !\u000a\u000a\u000a

VOk, here is what i have with the logo (not the channel avatar), just an idea for it really http://imgur.com/Hfuk58x.\u000a\u000aIf you notice on my HoN channel that my avatar is different than my video intro. That logo in the intro was made for me by a fan, just in case you thought i have the skills to make one now.

VDo you want an animated logo or something static? Are you mostly looking for a "graphic" like the above or a full blown splash screen/cover photo?\u000a\u000aAlso do you have any concerns regarding the use of copyright material (Pokemon)?
p4990
sI4
VI think i can take care of the animation unless you or someone else can create a custom animated intro using something like After Effects. It's mainly just the logo i'm concerned about, i'm not that good with image manipulation. The copyright isn't a problem, shouldn't even be something detectable since these are drawn arts by a fan base. If you are offering to help, inbox me your skype and we'll talk more :) Thanks.

V\u000a\u000aFor example:\u000a\u000a1.  The Roman Catholic Church says that life begins at conception (aka egg fertilization)\u000a\u000a2.  It says that all humans, whether specially created or evolved, have and have always had specially created souls for each individual.\u000a\u000aThe "got ya" question:  "It's well known that fertilized eggs sometimes fail to stick to the uteran wall, meaning that fertilized eggs gets dumped from the body during the menstrual cycle.  Why would god make it so that women's bodies dump fertilized eggs (aka living souls) into the toilet?  Did he design the human body to kill babies naturally?  Why?"\u000a\u000a-----\u000a\u000aIt would seem to me that this is an interesting point.  For Catholics who carry the ideology as proposed by the Vatican, they have a quandry on their hands.  Sometimes people address these questions, providing possible answers to explain why their ideology still fits with the facts of reality.\u000a\u000aHowever, it is becoming notable that such questions are sometimes labeled as "trap questions" or "gotcha questions" and dismissed as such.  As if calling a point of contradiction with a narrow scope a trap somehow invalidates the legitimacy of the point.  I would admit, as most would, that one single contradiction isnt enough reason to abandon an ideology.  Afterall, why throw out the baby with the bathwater?  But to dismiss it as not being credible merely because of its small scope is foolish.  Its sometimes the small question that can lead to a much greater discussion.\u000a\u000aIt seems as if these "trap questions" are hand waved off and never answered, not only because there is likely no good answer at the present time but because FAITH is the ultimate gap filler.  And it leads me to the conclusion that this is something that is being used improperly.  I cannot pretend to know enough to justify everything i  believe, but that doesnt mean i dismiss credible points simply  because its outside the scope of making me change my whole view.\u000a\u000aI find the term "gotcha question" or "trap question" to be a form of special pleading.  Its perfectly acceptable to create a long and elaborate criticism of an ideology, but for some reason pointing out an apparent, single contradiction isnt worthy of consideration.  At the most one could argue that such questions are incomplete or perhaps even lazy.  But all questions made with substantiative evidencd and reason deserve consideration, whether to be  answered or discredited.  Anything else is a cop out.
p5002
sI1
V>And that question doesn't have a glib, one-paragraph answer, so it requires an audience that's actually interested in accepting theological precepts before an answer can be constructed.\u000a\u000aWhat precepts? 
p5003
sI2
VIt depends on whose solution to the problem of evil we're talking about.  I'm most familiar with Leibniz's theory of "the best of all possible worlds.  Roughly summarized, it states that we live in the best world that is theoretically possible while still obeying the rule of cause and effect (which is necessary for human happiness and growth).  Any perceived imperfections in the world are the result of accommodating human imperfection, and removing any of these imperfections would, through cause and effect, result in greater evils.\u000a\u000aOther theologians take a different approach: for example, the idea that evil exists for transformative purposes, and a world without physical evils like sickness would not provide mankind with a means to grow spiritually, thus creating greater happiness.
p5004
sI3
VI dont think you have grasped ny point here   im saying that such points of cobtradiction should not be hand waved off.  \u000a\u000aYou said that the audience sometimes lacks interest in accepting theological precepts.  When i asked which, you said it depends on whose problem of evil we are talking about.\u000a\u000aIm completely lost.
p5005
sI4
VSorry about not being specific.  I also should have said principles rather than precepts.  It depends on whose approach you want to follow, but for most cases, you would have to accept that Christians believe morality isn't relative (otherwise you have the response, "Why weren't we made to enjoy everything exactly the way it is?"), and that death is only perceived to be evil and that there's an afterlife (otherwise it's hard to accept terminal illness as being for a greater good).\u000a\u000aI can't speak for everyone, but in my experience, a lot of times people would dispute these when they came up.  That makes it impossible to advance beyond the handful of basic arguments, which is why I suspect that some Christians are tired of entering into the same arguments over and over.

VHey guys, long time lurker. Recently i've been wondering two things: the first one is where do you find your inspiration for your next purchase? Like do you choose something on the shelf in front of you or do you seek find and destroy your next target by any mean?    \u000a\u000aAnd main question: what book do/did you use in your way through your whisky world? I'm talking about beginner book ("gf want to learn" style), reference book (like JM's Bible just to have a big list of existing whiskys), and advanced knowledge book (extensive history about this or that, crafting, distillery etc.).\u000a

VSoil is definitely quite an issue. The idea was to create an atmosphere very heavy in greenhouse gases, especially water vapour, and basically force extreme storm conditions, which would hopefully help with erosion of the surface. Then lots and lots of genetically engineering bacteria. Still, I may have to handwave much of it, which would be a real shame.
p5017
sI2
VEven if you're not deliberately handwaving it, you're really massively handwaving it. This is science fiction, not engineering. The key thing is authenticity, rather than realism.  So, something you might consider is putting having the environments somehow marked by their rapid transformations.  See if it eases your conscience?\u000a\u000a"This place is really beautiful - too bad it reeks of ammonia."\u000a\u000a"Yeah, can't be helped though, this is one of the rapids.

If I want it to be so I just have to say that it is, with a sufficient level of convincing. :) 
p5019
sI4
VDetails aren't always important either. You are dealing with technology and situations that have no real answer yet, so every answer can be disputed. By being vague about details that don't pertain to the story people are less likely to question those details. And I'm some cases, they may just fill in the details with their own ideas and be more fulfilled than with your explanation. \u000a\u000aJust don't rely on tricks like this. If all the tech is vague the world won't feel detailed enough to be believable.

I know I am. \u000a\u000aIt started me thinking though, I "cut the cord" a while ago and honestly have never been happier in terms of my entertainment options. The only issue with it, is of course, sports. \u000a\u000aNow, I love me combat sports. All of them. I don't care whether it is kickboxing, boxing or MMA.. I have mad respect for all of them. I have so much respect for them, I tend to toast them, with adults beverages when they walk in, when they through a shot, receive a shot, walk out - get my drift?

VSo, I am actually in this running class at the local college. We had two more session before class was over. \u000a\u000aLast Tuesday, our instructor told us that she was going to destroy our legs in this one. So expect it to be a tough workout and it was. \u000a\u000aWe started with a short jog to warm up and then over to a six floor parking garage where we ran up the steps to the 6th floor then back down the steps then up an incline and down steps then back the steps and then back down the incline to turn around and go back up the incline...well, you get the point. It was hellacious..but a lot of fun.\u000a\u000aWhen class was over, my legs were jelly.\u000a\u000aNext day DOMS got me good. My calves are sore mostly at the top behind my knee, quads are sore all over and hamstrings are sore all over. After that class, I went home and iced my knees and calves, and had my wife help me massage the sore places, but I am still very sore and I have a race on Saturday. I was going to attempt to break my old record, but if I am this sore, I fear, it could affect my performance.\u000a\u000a\u000aSo, do I continue with the ice and massaging.

VG - Guy\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000aBF - Best friend\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000aGF - Good friend\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a(all these people are my friends, including G)\u000a\u000aMy good friend is the one who needs this advice more than I need it. Back in November, my friend met a guy and they started to hang out more and more. They would spend hours on Skype chatting, message each other, you know, all the ingredients for young love. The guy started calling her beautiful and showering her with affection, however, he always maintained that he didn't want a relationship. One day, they hung out at her place and they ended up being intimate, twice. He took her virginity that night, both of them being consenting adult individuals.  \u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000aNot too long after that, he met another girl- my best friend. BF knows nothing about the relationship between G and GF. For a while, G and GF continued their "flirtationship", skype calls and sweet talking continued for a couple more weeks. GF hoped for a relationship, but G would repeatedly push that idea aside. Then, all of a sudden the flirting stopped very abruptly. G admitted to GF that he had feelings for BF, but his mentality had not changed regarding relationships. They had a huge confrontation after that, GF understandably feeling like G had used her for sex and then casually throwing her aside when another girl came along. Keep in mind that even though the flirting ended, G repeatedly told GF that she was his best friend and that he loved her. When GF told G that she felt like he didn't consider her feelings throughout all of this, G sort of twisted around the conversation and said things like "I thought we were best friends. I thought I could tell you everything and now you're acting like you don't care. I'm telling you that I have feelings for BF because we're best friends, shouldn't you be happy for me? You're hurting me because I thought we were being best friends."  \u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000aI really really don't want my best friend to be hurt the same way my good friend was hurt. My BF is absolutely 10000% NOT okay with a fwb relationship. She, like GF was, is a virgin and does not want to have sex with someone who does not want a steady relationship. G does not want any sort of romantic relationship, having stated many times that he just wants friends and not lovers.  \u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000aGF is afraid to tell BF about what happened between the two of them because she doesn't want to lose either as a friend. She also doesn't want to ruin the group dynamic between everyone because of what happened. I have told her not to have any hope that if she tells BF what happened, that G will come crawling back to her. He is a good friend to me, but what he did to GF was a bit manipulative and I just do not want this to happen to BF. I've kept this quiet as per GF's request, but I've talked to two friends (with her permission) omitting names as I've done here.   \u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000aWhat would you (from my viewpoint) do in this situation? What would you (from GF's standpoint) do in this situation? So sorry for the long text. If you read through it, I appreciate it. \u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000aEDIT: I'd like to add that one evening, G got drunk and told GF he loved her and wanted to be with her. This is why GF slept with him. She thought that they were going to be in a relationship which is why she slept with him. She did not use sex to try and get him to start a relationship. She thought they were going to be in one. Anyways, idk if this changes anything, but thank you all for the advices.
p5059
sI1
VI don't think he manipulated her when she slept with him. I agree that she hoped he would change his feelings about a relationship. What I think is that he was acting extremely selfish when she said she was hurt and then he told her that she should be happy for him and that she was hurting his feelings by not being happy about the situation. \u000a\u000aAlso, Bf certainly does not want to pursue a fwb thing with G. She's already stated this to me beforehand when the two of them began talking. "I do not want this to be a fwb thing." verbatim. Currently, BF believes that G wants to start a relationship with her. However, G has stated to me (without knowing what I know) that he does not intend to pursue a relationship with BF. \u000a\u000aBf does not like to waste time in a "flirtationship" without any intent to date. If she finds out that G just wants sex, not only will she be hurt, but she'll be hurt that GF did not tell her that G only wanted sex.

VHey y'all! I just received my Double Design "Air Max" style binder. 61$ USD, free shipping and free returns. I originally got a medium, but it was too large, so I sent it back and got the small size super quick (via First Class mail), and free. Their customer service is awesome and they respond very quickly. \u000a\u000aOnto the binder, it's a velcro style one, but you can also get the same style in pullover. I went for the velcro because I'm blessed with averagely broad shoulders, but a small ribcage, so pullover binders are either too small to get over my shoulders or too large on my ribs. Additionally, I have a ~34B/C chest and so gynecomastia binders don't have enough strength for my desired bind level. So for guys who are sort of built like cisguys, this binder is your shit.\u000a\u000aIt's cut sort of mediumly low/high in the armpits, not too much spillage but not too showy with a tank top. The neck is also cut in a low and wide scoop, which makes sure the binder doesn't show on all of my shirts (although if you wore this with a really wide scoop neck shirt, some would obvs show). The back is cut in the racerback style, which I find accentuates my back muscles nicely. It's also made of a thin mesh that's still very stretchy. The front binder pannel has an outer layer of spandex (maybe two?) and an innter layer of a soft fabric, which isn't nearly as stiff as the fabric on a gc2b binder. All in all, very comfortable design and veru breathable for summer. \u000a\u000aThe binding power is wow. Actually wow. I'm nearly flat and my chest only shows a little if i'm wearing an actual skintight shirt. It doesn't feel constrictive at all (even less than a GC2B). If you have the money, splurge and buy this binder. It's definitely worth it. I can post pics, if requested.
p5125
sI1
VAll I can say is that they're very well made and definitely worth the extra money. My GC2B binders both ripped within a month and the seams have come undone in several areas. This binder already feels that it will last longer. I think the price will be justifiable because it will most likely outlive most binders on the market, causing you to buy less in the long run. 
p5126
sI2
VWoah, I have a gc2b but it hasn't ripped. I know they're not very strong though, with all the loose threads. I don't wear my binder all that often. \u000a\u000aOh I just went to see how much shipping would cost, but they don't even ship to my country. :( Plus in my currency $61 is already $84.17.
p5127
sI3
V... My GC2B has thread coming loose on the lower back panel. I was wondering if I should contact them about it but I don't have any of the receipts, and even if I did, it's my only binder...\u000a\u000aOH well.

VAs everyone knows F2P players have a credit cap. This hindrance makes dealing with the GTN a annoyance for anything that isn't trivial to buy. So I've been thinking of a way to get around that and my current idea would be to buy high level crafting ingredients and then use them to trade for the high credit items that you would want. \u000a\u000aMy question is, is there a crafting ingredient that is always in high enough demand, and high enough cost to make this efficient?

VOn an added note, if a lot of people do this then the price for them will go up.  Thus making them a good investment either way until some new grade of crafting reagent comes along.
p5141
sI2
VThis. F2pers need to use their heads and do a bit of market research. You can easily be a billionaire in this game, without paying cent to BW. If you invest your money into high-priced items you may even make even more money. Also, you can eventually sell off your molecular stabilizers for unlocks.\u000a\u000aYou may even want to use them as currency, when trading with other players! Want that item that other FTPs can't afford in the GTN? Buy it with molecular stabilizers.

VI was having an argument with a friend about how this scenario would play out:\u000a\u000aYou are a cavalier with a flying mount. You possess the Mounted Combat feat and Ride-by attack. Your mount possesses the Fly-By attack feat. You make a move action through an enemy on your flying mount, make the mount grapple the enemy and fail. The enemy gets an attack of opportunity and hits your mount. *Does the Mounted Combat feat kick inn?*
p5147
sI1
VYep. We can break this down by requirements:\u000a\u000a> Once per round \u2713\u000a\u000a> when your mount is hit in combat \u2713\u000a\u000a> as an immediate action \u2713\u000a\u000aIt was only once per round, your mount was hit in combat, and you were free to perform an immediate action. Yep, this is perfectly legit.
p5148
sI2
VDoes this work, though? I thought an Immediate action can only be taken when it is *not* your turn and takes up your *next* swift action. This would imply to me that you cannot make an Immediate Action on your own turn, only a Swift Action, which Mounted Combat is not.\u000a\u000aEdit: I'm wrong, it can be done.\u000a\u000a> Much like a swift action, an immediate action consumes a very small amount of time but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy than a free action. However, unlike a swift action, an immediate action can be performed at any time\u2014even if it's not your turn.\u000a\u000a
p5149
sI3
VIt specifically says at any time though.
p5150
sI4
VHe's not saying you can't do it at any time - he's saying if you use your immediate action on player A's turn, and the next turn is you, you can not use your swift action because your immediate action and swift action take up the same action economy slot.\u000a\u000aPut simply: Swift Action = Immediate Action. They are the same "instant" action. If a rule says swift it means only on your turn, and if it says immediate it means at any time, but you still only get one.

VSo, this is my first chronicle, and I need help.\u000a\u000aOne of my players has a character whose sister had her soul slowly consumed by Raksha, and after that she was sold off to the Guild as one of those doll-like, soulless husks the Fair Folk don't need anymore. My player's character is looking for a way to recover the aforementioned soul.\u000a\u000aI don't think there is one, canonically, but this is a great motivation for the character and I want her to think something can be done anyways (and maybe there *is* a way).\u000a\u000aNow, the character is gonna ask a goddess what to do to get back her sister's soul. This goddess has a modified version of Voice of the Oracle - she should probably be able to tell her at least where to get the info she needs about restoring her sister's soul. They will meet on our first session, this Friday, if all goes well. The goddess will ask for a favor of course, but after that she should actually be able to give some kind of answer, perhaps disguised as a riddle, but an answer nonetheless - she's actually pretty nice as far as gods go in Exalted.\u000a\u000aWhat should the goddess tell the character? Is there actually a way to restore a soul devoured by the Fair Folk? Do Fair Folk actually consume souls as I'm assuming (I read something to that effect both in 1e and 2e, not sure if they still do it in 3e)? If they do, is the soul reduced to nothingness or does *something* remain in the Fair Folk who ate it, or elsewhere? Would some kind of sorcerous working, no matter how powerful, possibly work? Some kind of artifact? Is there a book or other reservoir of knowledge that might give hints about how to proceed, or is there someone, maybe a god, maybe an Exalted savant, who would know about restoring souls, or souls in general?\u000a\u000aIt's a lot of questions, I know, but I'd be very grateful if you could help me. I do have an almost complete 2nd ed library and even some old books from 1st ed, so if there are characters, artifacts and so on you feel I should check out, just tell me where to look.\u000a\u000aNon-canon suggestions accepted of course - if you have advice on what manner of sorcerous working or artifact would work, or would be cool to introduce, please do share!\u000a\u000aThank you. I'm quite in over my head. I could just invent stuff at random, but I'd like to follow the setting as close as I can, and honestly, doing less work would be an added bonus (one of the reasons I'm asking for your assistance).\u000a\u000aEDIT: I just realized the soul of the PC's sister doesn't need to be utterly gone. The dream-eaten in 2nd edition have permanent Willpower 0, but that means their souls must still be there, right?
p5154
sI1
VDo you know whether even minor feys like hobgoblins are allowed to eat of a mortal's soul? B/c I think the PC would choose to track them all down. Thankfully the soul-devouring happened all in the same pocket of Wyld, a small one I located in a crystal cave behind Greyfall's waterfalls.\u000a\u000aThat N/A artifact should certainly be something built in the 1st Age. Something similar to the Monstrance of Celestial Portion? Who built *that*, BTW? Or I could search Book of Sorcery - Wonders of the Lost Age and find something similar... with a good deal of luck.\u000a\u000aWhy hitting up Lytek? Her sister wasn't Exalted, and he's the god of Exaltations, isn't he? Actually, is there a god of souls, of reincarnation, something like that?\u000a\u000aI think the player would love for the character to go all "Come at me bro" to all the Fair Folk in Creation XD
p5155
sI2
VThe Monstrance of Celestial portion (the things that make Abyssals) were created by the deathlords with help from the Neverborn. I don't know if that cannon will be carried over to 3rd ed though.\u000a\u000aPerhaps one of the deathlords or Neverborn could be of assistance. This could be your players first brush with playing with things they really shouldn't. Opening them up to eventual corruption. One of the things they could do is help your player deconstruct the fae souls and retrieve the component parts and put them back together. With some surprise "additions" to create some story plot for later.
p5156
sI3
VYes, not bad... The Neverborn should be able to do something like that, and Mask of Winters could be the one to approach, the one acting as the Neverborn's mouthpiece...\u000a\u000aI don't think he could help in such a project on his own, unless he tried a sorcerous working, because I've read the most powerful necromantic spells and there's no way to save a soul. The best spell reanimates a dead person for less than a day.\u000a\u000a... But with the Neverborn's help, it would be possible perhaps to craft an N/A artifact to collect the souls from the dead fae, and then, as you say, put them back together... maybe she lives for some years and Mask of Winters takes her into custody as part of the bargain, trains her, makes her an heroic mortal...\u000a\u000a... and then the supernatural glue keeping the fragments of her soul together in her body disintegrates and she finds herself on death's threshold, and she can either finally die forever or become an Abyssal...\u000a\u000aI've gotta think about this...
p5157
sI4
VThis kind of stuff is easy to do early on. Your players shouldn't know the corruption involved with Mask of Winters. Maybe he presents him and the Neverborn as victims who only want to help creation in any way possible. Perhaps he presents the NB as beings cursed by the fae at the start of creation as a way to gain empathy for their common fae plight?\u000a\u000aWhat effect will this have on the Loom? A new fate that is in control of the NB?\u000a\u000aWhat about the Fae? How will they react when their dead brethren at the bottom of the Labrynth lie and pin the "Curse" on the Fae possibly starting war? \u000a\u000aWhat if the new sister of your player returns as an exalted from a stolen Exaltation from Sol Invictus? How will the players react? Who will her allegiance be to?\u000a\u000aSoooo many story lines possible.\u000a\u000aEither way, now is the time to set up deep plot hooks, and your players have presented you with a great tool. This one quest could fuel a huge story arc.
p5158
sI5
VIndeed! And this from only one player, I guess I'll have my hands full if I take into consideration even the projects of the other one! X)\u000a\u000aThank you - I hope I'll be able to have Mask of Winters play them for fools =D

VI've seen people do stupid things while they are sober. its not weed that causes it, its the stupid. \u000a\u000athat said, i dont think your comments were out of line. DUI does need harsher punishments. one of my former co-workers got a 2nd DUI and just had to have a breathylizer installed. i heard stories that he taught his 4 year old how to blow in it so he could start the car. *yeah*...think about that for a moment and let it sink in. \u000a\u000ai was appalled that could even happen. i dont think jailtime is approprite for a first offence, but definaly suspension of liscence. driving while suspended should mean jailtime, and DUI while suspended should be loooooooong jailtime. breathylizer is clearly a waste of money and jeapordizes public safety.

V>I've seen people do stupid things while they are sober. its not weed that causes it, its the stupid.\u000a\u000aNo idea why but this really clicked for me. Maybe it's the way you worded it, maybe it's because it just finally clicked, but you are 100% right. That makes me a bit sad though, because what was once an excuse, is now just a fact. That stupid people will do stupid things, and that sometimes put peoples life in danger. \u000a\u000aI'm glad you can be honest with me, and come from both stand points, I seriously had so many ''pot advocates'' on my nuts about what I said, when I was agreeing with the fact that it can be used for medical reasons, just as long as people are smart with using it.

Vwant to know the scariest part? the stupid people can vote. \u000a\u000ai think i had the same "click" a while back. democracy seems really cool on paper, honest, responsible citizens participating in their government to keep things balanced and in check. ha! like that happens. people just stupidly and selfishly vote for whatever helps them the most, or whatever one pet issue they think is most important to them. \u000a\u000athats when i realized the case against democracy. George Carlin put it best: [the public sucks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFDND9SRJbs) and its a great arguement for a republic instead of a democracy. many of the forefathers duked it out over this issue and its why the US is both but neither, its actually a "democratic republic"

VThat was a nice video to watch, I am glad I am not the only person who feels as you do, as well as George Carlin. Sometimes I feel as if I am all alone in thinking that people are stupid, and advocate for such stupid things. The only thing I want is equality for all, and not because of my sexual orientation. I want equality for all because everyone is a human being regardless on race, orientation, or gender. I get so pissed when you can't even have a discussion with someone without them blowing their lid and not taking anything into consideration.\u000a\u000a80% of my family did not vote for Obama because he is black. I'm not saying he should or should not have won, I didn't keep up with everything. It just made me sad to know they would not listen to what he was saying based on his race. \u000a\u000aIt makes me question where the future is going and at what point will the United States get with the program.

VThat does not address the issue though. \u000a\u000aHow would a deregulated/unregulated capitalist-based market system avoid child labor? At this point, it's an inevitability as the working poor would be exponentially poorer, and thus all the more desperate; coupled with the higher demand for even cheaper goods... A truly "laissez-faire capitalist" society would be rife with child labor. \u000a\u000a*Most* consumers easily trade moral standards for cheaper/easier goods. 
p5186

VBy making people wealthy enough that the children don't need to work. \u000a\u000aWhich is exactly what happened in the US and Europe. \u000a\u000aNot having children work to support the family is a luxury that parents will grab as soon as it is available to them. 
p5187
sI3
VHow would the working poor make *more* money by reducing the minimum wage (possibly to zero)? Furthermore by reducing the ability to stay afloat sans working (welfare/unemployment) would flood the labor market with unskilled (even skilled) labor, further driving down wages. \u000a\u000aI know you'll point to countries with no minimum wage and ignore the fact that they have a much stronger (and larger) public sector as well as very strong unionization and very strict borders or immigration. 
p5188
sI4
VThe US started banning child labor about 80 years before passing minimum wage laws. \u000a\u000aChild labor is made unnecessary by raising wealth levels in society. \u000a\u000aWhich is what actually happened in real life over the 19th century in the US. \u000a\u000aSo yes, I'll point to a country where it happened without a minimum wage: The United States in the 19th century. \u000a\u000aUnions can certainly play a part in raising more immediate wealth distribution (and I have no issue with private sector unions) \u000a\u000aBut unless you raise the average wealth level of the society, none of that matters as the wealth isn't there to be distributed. \u000a
p5189

VRight, you did not address the issue *at all*. If anything, you proved my point.\u000a\u000aThe US had child labor all the way up until they had to *ban it*. \u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aWe need to back up and address the situation as presented. How would a laissez-faire capitalist system be devoid of child labor? How would eliminating the minimum wage and welfare programs *help* the working poor in a laissez-faire capitalist society? \u000a\u000aNot... Was it worse before in the United States?

VIt is my pleasure.

It is also the nature of the worlds balancing mechanism; viruses, bacteria, bacteriophages, fungi, and parasites are constantly evolving, mutating, in order to replicate/reproduce, and spawn in its target species. The world built these diseases as a way of balancing populations, culling weak genetics, forcing immunity to evolve, and keeping everything in balance. When the movie 'Contagion' came out, it struck a major cord with me because of the fact the science behind the film was sound, and due to humanities ability to move about the globe like never before, it could be our undoing. \u000a\u000aIt is very likely that we could be seriously affected by super volcanoes, or climate change. NASA recently put out a 140 year climate model that forecasted the future of severe droughts and severe rain/storms. Many areas are going to be uninhabitable unless the local populations adopt methods of dealing with drought or superstorms.\u000a\u000a\u000athe list goes on and on, there is NO reason not to prepare for a situation unless they simply don't want to.

VHello I've been looking to upgrade my rig (look at my previous post if you want to see what it is) for college. Someone suggested a easy way to do it was crossfiring 290's as I already have one. I've never crossfired before so I have a few questions about it. First how problematic will microstutter and other crossfire issues be to me. How much worse will the heat issue be specifically because it will be in a dorm. Will a 750W power supply be enough for them. Also I was thinking about getting a different [brand](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814202143&cm_re=290-_-14-202-143-_-Product) however [I have this one](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125505&cm_re=290-_-14-125-505-_-Product), and the first one (the sapphire) has a clock speed 63mhz faster and ram 200 mhz faster so how much of a hassle would it be the overclock the first card up to that? Would it worth just selling my 290 for a 295x?\u000a\u000a\u000aAlso I'm looking to get a 2560 x 1440 monitor which is a driver for this decision\u000a\u000a

p5258
sI5
VYou *could* cover every tile around you, inside the spawn area (including the safe area!) with walls, but that would be ~16k wall pieces! Far easier is to use lava on the surface below this area, preventing any spawns there. \u000a\u000aIn general, player placed walls only prevent spawns within a contained area. If there is no ceiling (and empty, wall-free tiles above) then you can get spawns there (in front of your player placed walls). This is what the NPC spawning guide describes.

I mean, what happened to Cordi wasn't directly Angels fault like in King Lear, but by being in Angels world, she got into troubled times if you get what I mean.

Therefore you shall before all things learn well these two things so that you understand them rightly.\u000a\u000aMS 3227a:\u000a>Because of this fencing teaches the feeling well as Liechtenauer says: "Learn the feeling, Indes is a word that cuts" because if you are at the sword with someone, and you are now skilled at feeling whether your opponent is weak or strong at the sword, **Indes or while you are in the bind**, you may very well observe and plan what you should do against him.\u000a\u000aI'll concede that Meyer discusses indes in a different way than the Liechtenauer sources, but in general in the earlier sources, Chidester is right, Indes and Fuhlen from the bind are always discussed together. Also, I don't find this pairing unnecessarily complex (also note that Chidester's argument is for a "paring" not a "conflation" of these two concepts). In fact, I've taught hundreds of new students indes this way without them having a problem understanding the idea or being able to put it into practice.

Vhttp://pastebin.com/m6fb3fL8\u000a\u000aThat's what she sent to me. My particular questions are regarding her talking about her sex adventure (this was after I told her she better be adventurous, how I can't talk to a girl who isn't, and told her to tell me her craziest story), her talking about if I'll use the job title to get ladies, and her saying she's not exactly looking for love at the moment.\u000a\u000aBackstory: My initial message was to the hot chick was, "Your profile sucks." She replied, "Your face sucks." And then I kept going back and forth and eventually the conversation became longer, her responses became 10x warmer and at times slightly sexual, etc. \u000a\u000aAnd why on FB? Because I am living at home in NJ at the moment, lost my job a month ago in a city I was working in, and she is 2.5 hours away, or 30 mins from the city I was working in, and I'm trying to get a job back there regardless. So I told her that OKC sucks, we'll meet up down the line, but let's just keep talking over FB since I'm getting rid of my account.\u000a\u000aHow do I proceed?
p5329

V>how do I respond to "Is that how you'll get all the ladies?"\u000a\u000aAgree and amplify.\u000a\u000aIt's a good sign that she's sharing her sexual adventures, since it means that she likely sees you as a sexual person.

p5331

VAh, that's intriguing. Life's funny, she seems cool, wonder if and what will come of the conversation. \u000a\u000aHere's how I was going to respond to a few things she said --\u000a\u000a> One of my favorites is I had sex in the bell tower of Old Main at Penn State (you're not allowed access).\u000a\u000aI wouldn't have taken you for an exhibitionist, nice. When I have sex in public I prefer anal on the street corner, you know, a mild public display of affection. \u000a\u000a> You gonna use that title to get all the ladies? \u000a\u000aIt's one of the easiest thing that gets women trembling. Hopefully you were sitting, but at least use a wheel chair so you can wheel to the front of the line. I can make exceptions to line cutting for special people.\u000a\u000a> But yeah, I'm weird. I'll admit it. (Oh, what now?!)\u000a\u000aAs long as you know it and own it you're good. Boring chicks are no fun to be around, anyway.\u000a\u000a((**and then ignore the comment about what she's looking for, or supposedly looking for, and respond to her stuff in conversation normally**))\u000a\u000aThoughts?\u000a

Molag Bal's fathering the vampires (literally, if you subscribe to [a certain school of thought](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/opusculus-lamae-bal)) causes a great amount of discord.

p5381

VHow do I find the local minimum and maximum?
p5382
sI2
VOkay, so I did find the answer. I just took the derivative of the function and set it equal to zero. Each value for x is the min/max.
p5383
sI3
VIt's true that the extrema occur when f'(x) = 0. But you have to be careful. Just because f'(x) = 0 it doesn't necessarily mean that there is an extremum.\u000a\u000aFor example, consider f(x) = x^(3). Its derivative is f'(x) = 3x^(2). The derivative equal 0 when x = 0. BUT, the function x^3 **does not** have a maximum or a minimum when x = 0.
p5384
sI4
Vokay, so what's the right way of doing this, then? If I might get it wrong sometimes by finding instances where f'(x)=0, then what is the proper way of doing it?

VSo, Moffat is leaving and, as a result, I've seen a lot of Whovians saying that he's a bad writer. I don't think this is fair. With Blink, The Girl in the Fireplace, Listen, The Time of the Angels/Flesh and Stone, and even as recently as Heaven Sent he showed he is an excellent writer.\u000a\u000aBut there's one thing that Moffat can't do, and I think it proved to be his downfall, and that's kill characters.\u000a\u000aConsider Rory dying (neigh, being erased from time) at the end of Cold Blood... And then he's back again.\u000a\u000aHe kills Clara... multiple times. In Asylum of the Daleks, she dies. In The Snowmen, she dies. As a result, she receives the nickname "The Impossible Girl". Okay, great.\u000a\u000aShe then jumps into the Doctor's timeline at the end of series 7 and, even though it's super emotional, nothing really happens? Or did I miss something? I know, I know, she's now been fragmented across the whole of the Doctor's time-stream - or something - but this is problem with Moffat...\u000a\u000a...Because when he decides to kill Clara *again* in Face the Raven, I'll be honest, I rolled my eyes. I just asked myself, "well, how's he going to un-kill her this time". Sure enough, he did - sort of...\u000a\u000a...But that's what I mean, "sort of". Moffat has made it so that death in the Whoniverse doesn't mean anything. That shouldn't be the case!\u000a\u000aRemember when Russel T. Davis erased Donna's memory and you cried? That wasn't just because T. Davis was a great writer (Moffat's a great writer) or because Tennant's a great actor (Capaldi and Smith are great actors). It's because when T. Davis killed Donna's memory, you know he *meant it*. And he did. There was no going back. Her memory is gone, and that's stayed that way, and it still chokes me up as a result.\u000a\u000aBut when you send Rory and Amy back in time or what have you in Angels of Manhattan? I'm not as sad as I should be. Rory even pointed out himself in that very episode that, every time you think he's dead, he finds a way to come back. And he does. Moffat may have been lamp-shading himself there, but that doesn't make it okay.\u000a\u000aOther examples? There's "Me". Created in series 9, this character literally *can't* die. Which is a perfect encapsulation of the problem I'm talking about. If the character doesn't fear death, it sort of makes them dull. Missy's dead, then she's not. Osgood is dead, then she's not. Danny Pink is dead, then he's not, and then he's dead again.\u000a\u000aMoffat has pulled my heartstrings on several occasions. He's taken the show in bold directions, albeit not always for the better. He's shown me sides of the Doctor that have made me laugh, weep, and think. He's great at what he does...\u000a\u000a...But he *can't* kill characters. When he does, I just don't believe him. That's his fatal (pun intended) flaw.\u000a\u000aThoughts?
p5411
sI1
VYou raise some fair points, especially the latter. But I have to agree with OP - Death is Expected, now. And When it happens, it's not going to be permanent, or something will make it less impacting. Perhaps if Moffat or Chibnall steps back from the concept for a bit, it would regain it's meaning. We don't Always want happy endings.\u000a\u000a"Please give me this. Just once... Just this once, Rose, everybody lives!"\u000a\u000aOr,\u000a\u000a"Everybody knows that everybody dies. But not Every day. Every once in a thousand days, when the wind blows still and The Doctor comes to call... Everybody Lives."\u000a\u000aWith the last few series, we've lost that message.\u000a\u000aEdit: For clarification, I believe Moffat to be a Good writer, just a little obsessed with Shock value in recent series. With Clara gone, and this being Moffat's final season, perhaps we'll get the sharp edge of the knife back, instead of the bluntness it's been in certain story arcs.

VLegoK9, I have to go with GildasMagnus on this one.\u000a\u000aI appreciate what your saying with the way RTD brought Rose back, but (to me at least) it felt like a major exception. I remember how epic it was to see flashes of Rose throughout series 4 - because we had been taught to believe that death means something in RTD's Whoniverse.\u000a\u000aThose two quotes that GildasMagnus highlighted are especially interesting 'cause the second is from a Moffat episode. It goes to show that, as I keep saying, *he's not a bad writer*.\u000a\u000aHe's just terrible at killing characters. When RTD had the reigns, and Moffat had a few episodes, death felt tragic. The Girl in the Fireplace is  another example. She dies, and I felt it, and that was another Moffat episode.\u000a\u000aBut it was a Moffat episode with RTD at the helm. And, as a result, it was a Moffat episode in a Whoniverse where death had lasting meaning.\u000a\u000aMy personal feeling is that Moffat has ruined this somewhat.
p5413
sI3
V>Those two quotes that GildasMagnus highlighted are especially interesting 'cause the second is from a Moffat episode. \u000a\u000aThey are both Moffat episodes, actually.\u000a\u000a>He's just terrible at killing characters. When RTD had the reigns, and Moffat had a few episodes, death felt tragic. The Girl in the Fireplace is  another example. She dies, and I felt it, and that was another Moffat episode.\u000a\u000aMadam de Pompadour is a historical figure. It would be rude not to have her die at the historical time. \u000a\u000aYou also have to take into account the fact that the actors for companions are, as far as I know, contracted year by year, so I think he intentionally writes alternate ending with the companion dying or not. We know he did this for Jenna when she was indecisive about if she was leaving at the end of series 8. Amy, Rory, and Clara were the first companions since Rose to have multiple series, and the first to spend more than one series with a single Doctor. \u000a\u000aBut fair enough on all points. 
p5414
sI4
VMy main takeaway from what you just said is that I misattributed a quote to an RTD episode when it was a Moffat episode. Dang it!\u000a\u000aContracts are a fair point. I suppose it's hard for viewers to imagine how much context affects TV writing. At least, it is for me anyway.

VWell I definitely appreciate this answer, sorry for the ambiguity. I was mostly looking for some kind of estimate in terms of square footage. I have no idea how to go about estimating the total square footage of every building on Earth, and that's the main reason I came here. Say we didn't posses the technology to build past one story, but we still required the same square footage to inhabit. How much of Earth's square footage would we still have for cultivation, hunting, recreation, etc? This is obviously impossible to calculate EXACTLY, but I'm sure there's some relatively close estimate we could come up with.
p5425
sI2
VI think you could come up with a "logical" estimate of how much space  would be needed if we started from nothing and were basically building horizontally instead of vertically.  So ignore the footage of all existing structures.  \u000a\u000aLet say world population is 7,307,973,000 as of now.  Lets say each person needs 150 SF.  I am basing this on the assumption that most "Studio apartments" have a size of 500 to 600 SF and can range as low as 300 square feet.  You can have families share and just scale up the SF a little.  Or people who want no kids,  you could have 2 people sharing something like 200 SF.\u000a\u000aThat math gives us the figure of 1,096,195,950,000 SF needed to house people in a single floor.  That is 39,320.62mi².  Not a lot of space would actually be used to house everyone when you know that there are 24,642,757mi² usable space out there.  \u000a\u000a\u000aEDIT:  The state of Ohio is 40,860mi².  So just stick all the people of earth in Ohio with some space to spare.  I bet that would be one rockin' party......and smelly.
p5426
sI3
VHaha great answer, love the Ohio part. But while it seemed very logical, you're only speaking to housing. What about all the square footage people use for entertainment, education, work, etc?
p5427
sI4
V> we still required the same square footage to inhabit.\u000a\u000aI ignored all the business/service sector stuff cause of the way you phrased that.  Can we make all that underground?  Then we can stick with Ohio.  Building down is the logical cheat to even your original question.  If we need to build it aboveground.....who knows.   I suppose it would not be that crazy to just double the needed space.  If 100% of the world population was out of their own house and in some sort of service sector area, they would probably actually need a lot LESS space that 150 SF each.  A lot of the space could/would serve many people.  My completely fabricated assumption would be that 150 SF per person for services such as grocery stores, hospitals, etc... would be way more than enough.  So lets say you need 78641.24mi².  Which apparently is the average size of a US State.  So pick a state at random and you might or might not be able to use it for this experiment.

If I go for Shadow, I get more elemental damage at start and can get the Aura effectiveness earlier, but can crit reliably later and VP after level 80~. \u000a\u000aWhile if I go for Duelist, I get early Critical chance and more life early on, but long time till I get Aura reduce and effectiveness. \u000a\u000aAlso, I was considering if I should even go to Shadow. Duelist into marauder and up to the Templar aura wheel might be better.

Backstory about it copied from /r/museumofreddit: \u000a\u000a>On November 5th, 2014, professional League of Legends player Bjergsen, Mid Laner of the incredibly popular Team SoloMid, hosted an AMA on /r/leagueoflegends. It had been pre-announced, so /u/Arebel spent over ten hours creating and formatting an impressive list of fifty questions for Bjergsen to answer, and the comment instantly took over the AMA.\u000a\u000a\u000a>Because the questions took so long to answer, /u/tbalbino said, "bjerg 0 1 0 after this." 0-1-0, in League of Legends, is when you have no kills, one death, and no assists. /u/tbalbino later said, "He got fb. 400 reddit gold inc." In League of Legends, "fb" stands for first blood, which is the first kill of the game, and a higher-than-normal amount of gold (400) is awarded to the player who gets it.\u000a\u000a\u000a>Soon after, /u/3hoho5 said, "If he gets 400 gold I'll eat a dick." By the time this comment was posted, /u/Arebel had already been twice gilded. /u/3hoho5 [+1]'s comment gained some traction and people started asking if they could collectively make it happen. At one point, /u/Dyrus , Top Laner for Team SoloMid, jumped in to help with the gold rush.\u000a\u000aNeedless to say, it did reach the 400 gold mark and exceeded it.\u000a\u000aLink to that post: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2lel5s/tsm_bjergsen_ama/clu14fx?context=3

VSo Netflix has been trying to get me to watch HighSchool of the Dead for the longest time, and I had some time last weekend and actually just sat down and watched all 12 episodes in season one. I am not really into how fanservice-y it was, but I loved the gore, the realisticness of it, and also the idea of going all martial arts on zombie asses. (I am blackbelt but truth be told in a zombie apocalypse I wouldn't want to put my hands in biting range of them.) So I went online and read all the way up to "act 30" http://www.mangareader.net/high-school-of-the-dead/30\u000a\u000aSo I am now wondering does anyone know when the next issue will be released and where I can read it.

p5445
sI1
VThanks. So from the looks of it, no one knows when a new one will be coming out. Or even if it will. Also what is a "aggregate site"?
p5446
sI2
VAn aggregate site is a website that 'steals manga'. We all know that scanlators are illegally uploading manga--but with their free time put into translating it into English for others to enjoy it. Scanlators upload to their own website (which can be found through manga-updates, the manga database site) or to Batoto (collective website made by scanlators for scanlators). That way website traffic goes to them so they can generate a little bit of money to keep the website up and fund buying the next issue of 'whateveryourinterestedin'. Aggregate sites like Mangafox, mangareader, and so on take the manga from the scanlator's website and put it on their own. Slapping a watermark, reducing file quality without permission. This allows for the aggregate site to divert page views to themselves, thus, taking away the ad-revenue so they get the money----instead of the scanlators who did all the work.

VRight now the top 4 Li Li builds in hotslogs.com all have Timeless Creature-Mending Serpent-Lightning Serpent. This is problematic.\u000a\u000aOn the flip side, it also creates a synergy between sub-par talents that make them strong when put together. This is one of the most potent aspects of the talent system--small improvements that click together to a powerful effect--and it just feels good, taking an underpowered talent at Lv1, knowing it will reward you at Lv7. Remove the bug, its unintended and overpowered, but please keep the synergy intact.\u000a\u000aHere's a suggestion: Instead of **Mending Serpent** healing a fixed amount of HP, **make it heal the ally for 66% of the Cloud Serpent damage**. This way, the Serpent build won't be as ridiculously effective, but the synergy with Lightning Serpent would still remain.
p5452
sI1
Vthey could make the heal based on the damage the serpent does, so the bounces would do less damage therefore less healing
p5453

VThe only problem with that is it would make the bounces virtually *require* the Mending Serpent talent, rather than being more-or-less viable without it.

VGiven all the info that's come out recently about the possible nerve damage in Smith's leg from his torn ACL/LCL, his draft stock has plummeted.  Once considered possibly the best linebacker in the class, and a lock top 15 pick, he is now sliding into the 3rd/4th rounds in mock drafts.  \u000a\u000aFrom watching his tape, he's a freak and could be a serious difference maker for us, especially given how thin we now are at linebacker.  The downside is, he will not be able to play for a least part of this season, or maybe this season at all.

VUgh I really don't like it when they cut their bangs too short, like to the middle of their forehead (like [this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/e4/1b/a6/e41ba67fd2b67f8b13d41d7b3c7044a6.jpg) and [this](http://33.media.tumblr.com/3a40ba9e6a04ae646b6a105a5755c8aa/tumblr_inline_najjyitGYU1s2k31g.jpg) and [this](https://36.media.tumblr.com/f1b9a6b40ac4b404397ed5f6672853a3/tumblr_inline_o43245RhEH1rh6q71_540.jpg)). Rapmon can pull it off usually, but it's so much better with longer hair. Sometimes I think the stylists are blindly following trends. Like their outfits for the new concept photos are all Gucci. High fashion can look ridiculous sometimes and I feel like the stylists don't care how it looks as long as they're up to date with the latest trend. ~~those stupid berets~~
p5476
sI2
VThere's just too much with the bangs in general. I think that changing their hair constantly so people will talk about them is half of their marketing strategy, so it seems like they go through every option to get enough variety. It results in some bad looks. But then again, I can tell that I have different tastes than some other fans so maybe for every look, there are people out there who love it. I don't even know what the trends are these days. Sigh.\u000a\u000aI respect that they go for high fashion sometimes. I also think that high fashion can be done well and it can be done poorly. But then again, it seems pretty subjective. I can see what they were going for: whimsical European school boy from another era. But clothing should still be flattering if you're trying to market yourselves, not just the clothes. I think part of it is that they were tied to whatever Gucci is doing this season. I saw photos from the runway, and I wasn't super attracted to that either though I saw what they were going for. \u000a\u000aHigh fashion is tough in general because it's supposed to be over the top; it's not street wear. And these are trained performers but not models or actors. Anyways, these kinds of shoots are probably just always going to be hit or miss. I'm glad that they attracted a big fashion house with some interesting pieces; at least it wasn't boring, I guess. I would've appreciated more thoughtful editing. It was a lot of look, as Tim Gunn might say.

p5484
sI2
V> we've pretty much phased out P2W games on PC/Consoles by simply refusing to give them money.\u000a\u000aI think its the opposite actually. \u000a\u000aConsole players are much more willing to spend $25-$100 upfront to buy a decent game, whereas the majority of mobile gamers hesitate at a $10 price point.\u000a\u000aSo to counter this mobile developers release free to play games then artificially gate content behind timers or energy systems and force players to pay to circumvent them.\u000a\u000aI feel like if mobile gamers proved they were willing to pay up front for quality content, developers would be more willing to make games without the P2W aspects. \u000a\u000aAs it stands its far more profitable to reskin a CoC clone and sell gems, than it is to make a good game and sell the game.\u000a\u000a>Hopefully mobile has the same sort of revolution soon\u000a\u000aTotally agree, I just think we need to reward the developers who are trying to phase out P2W content by buying their games, *as well as* giving less money to the developers pushing P2W.\u000a\u000a

VDota 2 might be free to play but some of those cosmetic items sell for a much as $400, i cant imagine many mobile users would be willing to pay that for something purely cosmetic at least not in a way that significantly differentiates it from P2W "whale" hunting.\u000a

VEh. They're not really meta tags. Are you new to webdesign/development? Meta (information on information) is used for information that isn't really showed to a visitor but it's information used by browsers, search engines, social networks, etc. \u000a \u000aThat external file, the jQuery file, is loaded *with* the webpage so its code can be executed *on* the page. \u000a \u000aEdit. I dont't know if my explanation really helps, [this image with the anatomy of a (x)html page might explain it better](http://dabrook.org/assets/images/uploads/Basic-Anatomy-of-an-XMTL-Page.png)

p5546
sI4
VReddit might not be the greatest example but okay. I'll try to explain it as simple as possible (English isn't my first language so I hope you get what I'm trying to explain). jQuery (and Ajax) are pretty much techniques to do something with data on a webpage. It can modify, send, load (etc) data *on the spot* without having to reload the page. \u000a \u000aA good example would be the up and downvote buttons. Normally you'd click the button, the data have to be send to the server so the page need be reloaded to actually send the data. With Ajax this process is done without having to completely reload the page, it sends the data to the server and the server can respond with something. It's like small parts of the webpage is communicating with the servers instead of the whole page. \u000a \u000ajQuery can, for example, modify elements on a webpage. Divs, spans, etc. So if I'd click a button, somewhere else on the webpage is modified. This isn't really stuff html and css does (however, there's this new version of css (3) that can do a lot of cool stuff like animations). \u000a\u000a* HTML is used for the content of the webpage. A block (a div) can hold some text. \u000a* CSS is used to style HTML and blocks with content in it. \u000a* Javascript (jQuery etc) is used to actually do something with the data on the page. \u000a\u000aThen there's a lot of other languages that communicate with the databases. If I'd have a database of names (like Paul, Peter and John) I'd (for example) use PHP to get these names from the database. So instead of (in the case of Reddit) having milions of comments in the webpage itself, they're stored on webservers and the urls/parameters of the pages let the PHP know which data should be retreived from the database. \u000a \u000aI can't really explain everything in just one comment. My advice would be to read and learn as much as possible to get a grip of how everything works. http://www.codecademy.com/ is a great resource to learn about html, css, php, javascript and lots of other stuff. It'll give you the basics of webdevelopment.

From 1962.  \u000a  \u000aNo restoration details yet, except that he told him it's fully restored and in beautiful condition.  I can certainly see if he can ask him the above minimum work you listed.  Anything else?  Even with that work done, would it be worth $500?  And would it drive his speakers?
p5559

VHH Scott was one of the top golden age tube brands, and the 299 is a pretty highly regarded model.  Looks like it uses 7189s for the output tubes, which is the same as my Sherwood.  The 7189 is a high voltage EL84 and is a very sweet sounding tube.  If the restoration passes the sniff test, I'd go for it.  They should be willing to open up the chassis and show you the work they did.  The restoration stuff is important.\u000a\u000a  [Here's some completed eBay listings so you can compare the price](http://www.ebay.com/csc/i.html?_from=R40&_sacat=0&_nkw=hh+scott+299b&LH_Complete=1&rt=nc).\u000a\u000aI don't know the specs of your dad's speakers, so I can't really comment on that.

VThanks!  I put the speaker specs up in the original post.  This is all really helpful, and I send him a summary of all this information.

V0.5 Blotter 25C-NBOMe = 400µg\u000a70kg Male 22 years old\u000a\u000a\u000aEarlier in the week I watched Life of Pi with a friend, we snuck in a bit of booze and vaporized a little weed. It was a visually amazing movie, but we left a couple times to vape the weed and check out some other movies in other theatres. So that was Monday, on Wednesday my friend Moo and I decide it's about time we test out the 25c tabs we have lying around. The blotters are dosed at 800µg each, and we check erowid and 800 is a fairly strong dose, so we cut them in half to get a more moderate 400µg dose. I always like to err on the side of caution when dosing a new drug, especially one which is relatively new compared to things like LSD and psilocybin. Moo and I had heard that vasoconstriction can be an issue with NBOMe's and dark chocolate is both a vasodilator (sort of) and delicious, not that we needed a reason to eat some tasty chocolate, any vasodilation from the chocolate was certainly not a factor, but the psychological effect may have helped.\u000a\u000a\u000a9:20 we pop the half tabs into our gums and try not to swallow any spit or move the tabs around too much. The numbing which many report comes on very quickly, the area immediately around the tab is numbed and the taste is awful. Keeping the tabs in place and preventing too much saliva from washing over them and around our mouths prevents the taste from saturating our mouths. We head to the bus stop and wait for the bus\u000a\u000a\u000a9:40 we get on the bus and we begin to feel the effects. The first thing I notice is the slight brightening of lights and a gentle pressure in the back of my head. Next comes on the body load people talk about. I experienced a bit of this on my first, and so far only, shroom trip, but this was much stronger and uncomfortable. I feel like I need to stretch all my muscles, especially my legs, feet, wrists and neck. My back and abs feel like they need to be stretched as well, but in a weird way, they feel like they're made of stretchy rubber, stiff but malleable, and quite uncomfortable.\u000a\u000a\u000a9:55 we hop off the bus and start walking towards the theatre, the cold air and brisk pace helped reduce the uncomfortable body feelings. I did a couple lunges and stretched my hips, I'm sure there were some confused spectators. \u000a\u000a\u000a10:05 we're in the theatre in our seats, I'm starting to feel a little giggly, and the visual component is definitely starting to become obvious. The body load is still quite uncomfortable, and staying still in my seat isn't a really fun time. \u000a\u000a\u000aAfter the first sequence in the movie, I'm fully distracted form the body feelings and loving the visuals, the fact the movie was in 3-D definitely improved the experience, and 30 minutes into the movie, I'm fully immersed and enthralled by the beauty of the film. The colours were astonishing and every frame blew my mind. Throughout the film I feel a deep connection to the movie and I empathize very strongly with the characters, having seen it once before, I spend more time analyzing the film and thinking of what the film represents. I'm not entirely sure, but I'm pretty sure the entire film is a metaphor for Indian history, I don't know much about indian history, so I'm hardly in a position to back up this theory. There are some sequences in Life of Pi which are simply stunning, I found my eyes watering because I couldn't blink for fear of missing anything, it was unreal. \u000a\u000a\u000aWhen the effect of the 25C was at it's peak during the movie, faces began to have slight patterning on them, sort of like aztec style face-paint but more intricate and ever so slightly neon tinted. The 3-D seemed to be treated differently by my brain than real things, because when I looked around the theatre, things looked like they were in the red-blue style 3-D you see on paper, where everything is copied in another colour right besides itself, very cool. \u000a\u000a\u000aAnother very cool effect of 25C was the way it widened my field of view. Normally you look straight ahead and focus on what you're looking directly at, but the 25C widened my field of view substantially, so much so that I could see the frame of my 3-D glasses clearly, even though they were right up against my face and normally not at all visible. Despite it widening my field of vision, it was super easily to be completely immersed in the movie, the film became my world, during the sad scenes I cried, and when things were looking up I felt happy to my core. The film was an emotional journey I will never forget, owing largely to the 25C alowing me to live in the film.\u000a\u000a\u000aAfter the film, we walked around the city, checking out the waterfront. We admired the hundreds of lights across the water and the giant cranes of the shipyard were unreal. Coolest were the legacy sculptures and pavilions from the olympics. The sculptures were very striking and interesting. We climbed above a very cool restaurant, and probably spent a good half hour laughing at the word Beeth, which is the natural plural form of booth, as in "which booth would you like? we have any available beeth". \u000a\u000a\u000aAfter laughing our faces off for a long time, we vapid a little bit of weed and continued walking along the water. Along the water we spot a raccoon, we laugh at the way raccoons look, and upon turning around, the racoon must have climbed down a ladder from the seawall to the shoreline, which is pretty cool. Then we followed the raccoon along the shore while he searched for food. We talked a lot about how cool raccoons are, and how cute they are. We walked off to check out some cool little areas and interesting buildings, and when we came back to the shore, about 400 metres down the shore, we look down, and we walked straight to where the same raccoon was. This ridiculous coincidence blew our minds and we were super stoked on finding the little guy. After following him a bit more, we walk back into the city and start heading home to the bus stop, it's about 3:30 at this point, and we're still tripping. The weed is definitely making us a little hungry, and while I'm not really interested in eating, a part of me wants to get some food in my body. We find a little breakfast place and grab a sandwich. After eating we head home and marvel at the giant circle we made throughout the night, starting and finishing at the same spot. I give Moo a big hug and head home, I listen to some music ting in my bed and drift to sleep slowly.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe next day was no problem at all, no real noticeable after effects, I did sort of feel that I was less able to multitask efficiently, but I may have just been more focused on one thing at a time. I'm not even sure this was an effect of the substance, but by far the easiest day after of any drug I've tried, besides marijuana.\u000a\u000a\u000aAll in all, this was a very interesting experience, it was like a background high, I felt very functional and aware of my mind and how the high was affecting me. I really liked the high, but the come up really wasn't fun, the body feelings were quite unpleasant for the first hour or so. The vasoconstriction wasn't bad, but I could feel my hands and feet were pretty cold, and getting inside and warming up I could see that my hands didn't have the best circulation, stretching a rubbing my hands helps push blood around, I wouldn't do too much more than 400µg unless it's quite warm outside because the vasoconstriction was no joke. I will definitely be doing this drug again, and at the same dosage, I really liked the intensity and duration at 400µg, but I am quite sensitive to psychedelics so some may prefer a couple µg more.

VI have always wanted to at least get gold.. I have never gotten it before, and mind you I have been playing this game for a long long time.\u000aWhenever I played ranked before I would always get really frustrated quit after awhile (either league or just ranked ques) and get demoted.\u000aTry again and get demoted again after stopping.\u000a\u000aNow I have been playing some ranked 5s with friends and we got gold really easy, and I thought "I can do this in solo que damn it! This time I am gonna do it" and it happened over a week i went from silver 3 into gold 5, and since then ranked has become so much more fun, now there is no more stress or frustration if we lose the game, oh well! and I've been winning more since then, playing Vel'koz mid mostly because of Sp4zie, and I've been performing great...\u000a\u000aMy point really is I think if I had just gotten over the stress of getting to gold I think it would have been a lot easyier to reach my goal, so all of you trying to climb just go in with a positive attitude (I have always tried to follow that rule) and if you lose the game, hey! Whatever you just keep on trying buko, don't play champs that are "OP" right now play something you enjoy, also I have found people don't always know how to play against niche champions..\u000a\u000aI will stop ranting now\u000a\u000aThis is Practical from EU West\u000aAnd i am now happy with solo que.\u000a\u000a\u000ahttp://www.lolking.net/summoner/euw/19660235 (my profile if anyone is curious)

VHey /r/arduino\u000a\u000a\u000aSo I am just getting into Arduino stuff and I am really excited. I have a  question about coding. So I have very little experience with real coding (I have been writing MATLAB scripts for years however, though I know that it isnt near the same). I want to know what languages you can use with Arduinos. From what I have read, I believe the standard Arduino language is some form of C. But I keep seeing tidbits of people maybe using Python. Does the arduino support multiple coding languages? If so, which ones? Also, which language do you think is the most useful to learn?\u000a\u000aAs a side note, I am a newly graduated ME (BS) and am looking to expand my education horizons on my own while having fun with Arduino technology.\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks for any and all help :)

p5582

VI have perused the reference page before. So as a verification, since it is all C++ the commands on the reference page share the same function as they do in all code? Or are they functions that were specifically added to the C++ language for the Arduino platform?

Vit's c++, but it doesn't have the full stdlibs.  the arduino IDE adds an "#include Arduino.h" to your sketch that pulls in the arduino framework when you compile.

VAfter trying out Chrome in Windows, I decided I didn't feel right about totally abandoning Firefox, so I started using Firefox Developer Edition.\u000a\u000aIt works perfectly with my old profile and all my extensions, but I couldn't make it default to that. It could automatically run the dev-edition-default profile, but if I set up profile manager to automatically enter my default profile, I would instead get the profile manager.\u000a\u000aFirst I made a shortcut with `-p default`. That works, but I don't know how it can be used for pinning to the Start Menu or Taskbar. The solution was to edit profiles.ini, which is found in `%APPDATA%\u005cMozilla\u005cFirefox` in Windows. Change `Name=default` to `Name=dev-edition-default`. There is no need to actually rename the profile from something.default to something.dev-edition-default, and doing that won't help. If you want to rename it, remember that there is also another part of the profile in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\u005cMozilla\u005cFirefox\u005cProfiles`. After this I got the profile manager and Firefox created a .default profile, but I was able to configure it to automatically start with my old profile.\u000a\u000aFirefox Developer Edition performs well. I'm not seeing any problems, it's probably faster than the current release, and there's multiprocess, and presumably content sandboxing.
p5611
sI1
VOn Windows, to pin it to start menu, taskbar, etc, you need to set the `System.AppUserModel.ID` on the shortcut. Profilist beta does this for you - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/profilist/versions/beta - after installing go to about:profilist - and use the "Create Desktop Shortcut" feature.\u000a\u000aAfter creating the icon, if you give it a custom icon, if the icon doesn't update, then you have to logout, then log back in.\u000a\u000aHere is a screencast using v2, which is slightly different from the current beta (v3) - https://youtu.be/fKw-BNWMyQM?t=3m51s
p5612
sI2
V[deleted]
p5613
sI3
VTrue true, however an issue is that when using non-default profile, the System.AppUserModel.ID is different. So when running the app, you will see an orphan firefox icon, as the windows will be going to taskbar icon with the default ID. So you are correct, this is only an issue if you are forcing your firefox to run other profiles. If you do it with the default profile, its a non issue as the System.AppUserModel.ID of the created shortcut is the default one.

p5647
sI1
V> A +1 Spiked Heavy Shield of Bashing ends up being a +1 weapon that does 2d6 damage, which is absurd for a one-handed weapon, especially when you slap Smite Evil on top of it. And that should be well within your wealth limits.\u000a\u000aI.. don't really get how you're getting that 2d6. [Bashing](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-armor#TOC-Bashing) just increases the die size. As far as dealing an extra d6 of damage, that's really not that much. You can put [Flaming](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Flaming), [Frost](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Frost), [Shock](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Shock) or [Merciful](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Merciful) on a weapon for the exact same price. All of those add an extra 1d6 damage to the given weapon.\u000a\u000aSeems perfectly reasonable to me, considering it's gonna cost you at least 8,300 gold for that weapon. The shield'll clock you in around 4,150, but is way more difficult to use properly. \u000a\u000aNinja Edit: Exact same price as in all of the above linked abilities cost a +1 Bonus. This raises the question of where does a spiked shield become a weapon instead of armor?
p5648
sI2
VLooking deeper.. a Spiked Shield is treated as Armor. Its bonuses _do not_ apply to attacks made with it unless it is created as a Magical Weapon, using the magical weapon prices. So you could get a +1 Flaming Warhammer that'll do 1d8+1d6+1 each hit, or you could get spikes to hook onto your shield. The only difference in cost would be the warhammer/spikes.
p5649
sI3
VThe Bashing property specifically says that "The shield acts as a +1 weapon when used to bash." Furthermore, it's an armor property that applies to the shield, rather than a weapon property that applies to the spiked bit or whatever it would apply to. It just happens to stack with the spike, with absurd results.\u000a\u000aAlso, I think there's a shield fighting feat way down the tree that lets you use the enhancement bonus as a weapon enhancement bonus, but I'm too lazy to look right now.
p5650
sI4
VYep. You're right, I was neglecting the _spiked_ bit. Many apologies. Also, that feat _does_ exist, so it's doubly moot.\u000a\u000aAlso, keep in mind that you can't make as many attacks with the offhand. (Here's a thought.. Shield as a primary attack? o.O)
p5651
sI5
VI'm just going to consolidate both replies, because I'm lazy.\u000a\u000aIn Pathfinder, the hand you declare as your off-hand is your off-hand. You can run around with a repeating crossbow in one hand and a sword in the other and alternate stabbing one turn and shooting the next.\u000a\u000aThere is a bit of silliness where it says "You can bash an opponent with a shield, using it as an off-hand weapon. Used this way, a shield is a martial bludgeoning weapon." Which is really kind of vague. *Can* I use it as a primary hand weapon? If I do, is it an Improvised Weapon? Do I have to take a special proficiency for it?\u000a\u000aAlso, in the other one, you mention TWF with shields as penalties. Consider the Shield Mastery feat:\u000a\u000a>You do not suffer any penalties on attack rolls made with a shield while you are wielding another weapon. Add your shield\u2019s enhancement bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the shield as if it were a weapon enhancement bonus.\u000a\u000aWhat if you're wielding two shields? Does that mean you can effectively dual-wield at your full BAB, with two 2d6 Heavy Shields of Bashing? Can that even be done, considering the "off-hand restriction" from before?

If someone was constantly making me that angry, I'd leave. If someone was yelling at me all the time, I'd sure as hell leave. Everyone has their "moments" when they are nice and things are great, but it's really not worth it. It is an abusive relationship and you need to cut ties pronto.\u000a\u000a> I just choose not to because it's hard for me to interact with people. I am ackward and weird.\u000a\u000aI was too, and still am to a degree. Really the only way to get rid of it (unless you have Autism or something) is just to get out there and interact. Accept the failures, it happens. I've had more than my share of "why did I say/do that, they will hate me forever!" moments. But honestly, people are people, and you can chose whether or not to interact with them at any time. If things don't go well, move on. I'm not saying I'm a socialite or anything, I'm just saying that I conquered being horrible around other people and the only way I did it was forcing myself to be around other people. And by doing that I made some great friends. If you're in a decent sized city, chances are you can find somewhere where fellow weird and awkward people hang out, and it's great.\u000a\u000a>Background of me I have dysthymic disorder. Have had it for 8 years. I have not gone to seek professional help because of the costs that come with them.\u000a\u000aSorry to hear that. I was diagnosed with clinic depression. It's tough, especially making it day by day. When things go wrong, it seems like the end of the world. Depression is a bitch, and it's horrible when people tell you to just smile. They don't understand that when you're really, truly depressed, it's like interacting with people while you're underwater in a wet suit. You see them, hear them, and can touch them, but there's some kind of weird fuzziness in the way and nothing can change it.\u000a\u000aOn that note, this probably has a lot to do with your relationship with your boyfriend. If you're depressed (and, I assume, down on yourself), it's easy to feel worthless and like you'll never find anyone better, even if you are being treated like shit. It's not a good situation, for sure.

p5673
sI4
VSorry. :( It's definitely hard, especially getting rid of someone from a 4 year relationship. Don't try to change everything at once. Start with the bad relationship (no "lets be friends"), and maybe find a hobby (not alcoholism, that's not a good hobby). Maybe try to socialize a bit too. If you try to take on everything at once, you will fail and you will gain more "I can never do this" feelings. Little steps are the best. But, in my opinion, you really have to do something about your relationship first.\u000a\u000aI need to head home and then I have to go pull a few parts for my car from the junkyard (again, I'm not the epitome of success here, I drive a 1998 Volvo lol). I'll be back in touch soon. Hang in there!

p5694

VGlad you responded. From what I've been told if there is a bound to size then there would never be a 1/0 point like infinite mass situation and instead the big bang would have been the big squeeze I assume you have heard this theory before. I thought energy at it's fundamental level came in discrete packets?

VEnergy at its fundamental level does not come in discrete packets, no. Again, some systems have discretized energy levels, and this becomes highly relevant on small scales, but that doesn't mean that energy itself is discrete.

VYep.  You can never be sure because the data is sampled, but it looks like a ~10k and a ~5k donation at the last minute swung it for save.\u000a\u000aSomething similar happened last year, and they read the last minute donation's comment on stream which was something like 'Get rekt; save the animals' if I remember correctly.

VI think Sam Harris made a point that we've already got collateral damage going on all over the place, and that torture for the purposes of interrogation, while completely unsavory, may be preferable to greater losses of life. I'm not sure where I stand with all of that, because its clearly a fucked mess of moral implications, but I can at least understand and agree with a part of the reasoning. Which is better, one person's suffering or thousands of deaths? That's a tough question, and I'd be hard pressed to give a very solid answer. Still, if you've already got people being tortured and killed, it doesn't seem like a huge stretch to use those same methods to save thousands.\u000a\u000aI mean, if we're battling Muslims for example, you could say that its torture to threat to bathe them in pig's blood, but if we simply ignore the religious implications, that's hardly a very terrible means of interrogation.\u000a\u000aI dunno. It's all a fuckin' mess.
p5748
sI4
VThis argument presupposes that the torture is effective.  While the evidence one way or another is a closely guarded secret, it isn't a secret that torture can at best produce questionable leads.  When someone will say anything to make it stop, the validity of the information is suspect.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, we have the recent case of the NSA and the wide range of surveillance methods used.  In defense of the practice, they claimed that it had stopped a multitude of terrorist attacks.  However, over several months that multitude became an ever decreasing number as they were pressured to provide some evidence of efficacy.\u000a\u000aI say this to say that if the only ones saying the torture was necessary are the ones that pushed for it in the first place (and could be facing war crimes charges), it is best to take it skeptically.
p5749
sI5
VI do take the process of torture to get information skeptically. I don't think its an especially effective method, we have truth serums for that actually, so I can recognize the problems. I've always been on the fence about it all.

Somehow I came away with no scarring at all and my skin looks almost perfect.\u000a\u000aHowever, one thing that bothers me about my skin is little skin colored bumps on my forehead. I think I have them on my cheeks and chin, but they are almost invisible there. Also, I think they go hand in hand with enlarged pores, which I have around my nose and cheeks.\u000a\u000aI can't help myself and end up squeezing them and giving myself red marks on my forehead, which is awful. \u000a\u000a[Here](http://i.imgur.com/skK8mri.jpg) is a picture. The quality is awful - I took it with my phone camera and tried to boost contrast and reduce exposure to make them more visible. If this picture is too crappy for any real advice, I can retake it with my digital camera at home. There is one red mark that resulted from me picking at/squeezing at one of these skin colored bumps and then next to it are some of the bumps if untouched. \u000a\u000aI know they are full of hardened oil because that's what comes out when I squeeze them.

VHey! so those definitely look like closed comedones. Typically we use an AHA and/or BHA to fix'em. The AHA tends to be recommended more often for closed comedones in particular...but some people find the combination works best.\u000a\u000aPersonally, I'm using both. And I've definitely seen progress for my own. The AHA tends to bring things up to the surface, whereas I feel like the BHA cleans the pores out a bit more. OCM massage is that extra factor that seems to slip stubborn ones right out. Highly recommend :)\u000a\u000aBrands: I'm using PC 8% Glycolic AHA, and the 2% Clear regular strength BHA. I tried Red Box Stridex, but I think it dried me out. YMMV, if you go with PC there are plenty of codes in the referral thread.

Vmy sweet spot is a 3.7 watt.  i got sigelei 100w and just made a new coil a single parallel 24 gplat reading at .2 to .3 and using "Cuttwood" and "Cosmic Fog" juice there is no burning.  Rip's juice seemed to be the only juice that burns my cotton.
p5772
sI4
VThat's weird, nothing about your build should burn your cotton. I had an issue with my tank one time where the cotton got stuck in the juice inlet hole and it wouldnt let juice in, if your on a tank make sure that your inlets are open. I just cut back my cotton a bit and that fixed it. Sorry I can't help beyond that.

VST has fought and beaten Silver Age Superman, he's tanked a anti matter wave that destroyed dimensions. His power is drawn from the green, the abstract concept of plants.

VHey guys, I've posted this issue on the gen boards but you know how that went haha. Around 2 weeks ago, I started getting this weird constant drop in fps. I don't know why it dropped so suddenly, I used to have no problem running LoL at maximum settings and maintaining a constant 60 fps. If anyone else has this problem, or knows how to fix it, can you let me know! Playing at 20-40 fps is quite the struggle. I've defrag'd, cleaned my registry, reinstalled LoL, and had no driver updates so I don't know why the lag started happening. I also don't lag on any other game I play :/. Also, playing at lowest settings doesn't do anything about the lag, just makes the game look shitty. If anyone has any suggestions please let me know! Thanks!

VI work at a small SaaS marketing startup located in the US.  We primarily provide text and email services to retailers domestically but one of our new retail clients has a few stores that are opening up in Puerto Rico.  \u000a\u000aSince our contract is with the US-based company, what will we need to do to legally do business in Puerto Rico?

VNot sure if this is the right spot, but hopefully some WoW players can help me with my DC problem when I raid.\u000a\u000aTo begin, my computer is in a room with my three roommates. We're all connected to the same modem through ethernet, two of them connected through a wired extender (only used so the two can reach and not buy super long cords), and I am connected directly to the modem. Our internet speed is 100 mbps. I am the only one who disconnects.\u000a\u000aI've replaced my graphics card (which now lets me run the game on High settings, and has a controllable cooling fan) and replaced my NIC card. Today I'll be replacing my Ethernet cord. The only other piece of advice I got after all of this is to reinstall Windows 7. \u000a\u000aWhen I raid, I set my graphics card cooling fan to 100%, and my card typically sits between 25-45 degrees celsius. My guild uses Mumble to chat during the raid. I know I'm about to disconnect because Mumble says, "Disconnected." and my game freezes. I get no notification from Windows about the internet DCing. After about 10-30 seconds I'm booted back to the login screen, Mumble reconnects, and I log in. \u000a\u000aAt first, before I replaced anything, I was DCing every hour or so. After replacing the graphics and NIC card, I was able to get through about two raids before I started DCing again. This last raid (Sunday), I disconnected at least 4 times towards the last half (1.5 hours) of my 3 hour raid. \u000a\u000aAs I'm sure you can all understand, this is extremely inconvenient, and I'm desperate for a solution. If anybody out there has been in a similar situation and found a fix, or if you have any further advice, I'd greatly appreciate it! Lok'tar Ogar!
p5800

VI'll definitely check the programs that start when my computer boots up and let you know if I catch anything. \u000a\u000aIf I can't find anything, or if I do and I still have a problem, do you have any advice for the next step? \u000a\u000aI mentioned that a colleague told me to reinstall Windows 7. Do you think that could possibly be beneficial?\u000a\u000aThanks for your advice, it really helps!
p5801
sI2
VYea it is entirely possible that reinstalling Windows 7 will fix it.  It wouldn't be a horrible idea to do but you'll have to reinstall WoW and back your data.\u000a\u000aHere are two more areas to look at.  On that msconfig window, goto the Services tab.  In the bottom left corner you'll see a "Hide all Microsoft Services" checkbox.  Check that.  It will make the list smaller and help keep you from making a big mistake.\u000a\u000aGo through this list and like you did in the startup tab.  These are services that run in the background of your computer when the computer boots up.\u000a\u000a2nd idea is go to your Control Panel, then look for "Uninstall a Program".  If you don't see it, type "Uninstall a program" in the search box in the upper right.  You'll see it then.  That will show you all of the software that installed on your computer.  Be very careful here.  Don't uninstall anything that has Microsoft's name on it, as a general guideline.  Double click anything here you want to get rid of and follow the wizard prompts to uninstall it.  Sometimes it's easy to get some "honest" virus' and malware this way.  I saved this for last cause it kinda sucks and the first two steps would've likely fixed your issue before this would.\u000a\u000aLet me know what you experience after that.
p5802

VI checked the programs. There was one "unknown" and two others that I wasn't quite sure about, so I went ahead and disabled them. \u000a\u000aI also bought my new Ethernet cord, and when I plugged it in I realized something kinda wonky: \u000a\u000aThe icon in the bottom right said I was connected, but had an 'X'. Upon looking at my networks, I had 'Local Area Connection' (Disconnected) and 'Local Area Connection 2' (Connected). I'm not sure if this is a thing or not, but perhaps at random it was looking at my disconnected connection for access, which kicked me? I disabled it, so we'll see if that helps. \u000a\u000aI'm doing a raid tonight using your advice and a new Ethernet cord. I'll let you know how it goes. 
p5803
sI4
VActually, the red 'X' is still there, even though the Local Area Connection that I was not connected to has been disabled. It doesn't seem to be causing any problems, just a cosmetic nuisance. 
p5804
sI5
VYou stated that you got a replaced the NIC card.  You see a second Local Area Connection because of this.  Windows sees it as different hardware MAC address so it made a second Local Area Connection.  Yea it'll be cosmetic.  You can right click the interface and rename it if it bothers you enough.\u000a\u000aThe hopping thing where it might be checking for a connection?  Neat idea but no, sorry.  Not normal operation for Windows.\u000a\u000aHope your raid went well.

VFirst off, upvoting you, kind sir/madam\u000a\u000aI actually have Reiki 1 under my belt (wanting to go for Reiki 2 at some point, but although I know I can Reiki myself ((which I haven't in a long time)) it always feels like it works best when someone else does it.. I used to always beg my friend back home who also had Reiki 1 to do Reiki on me when it didn't feel like it was helping enough with just me doing it)... Im also taking Tai Chi 42 forms... Is this at all helpful? I'm also taking meditation at school (I used to go to a weekly meditation circle when I was still living with my folks but it disbanded around the same time that I moved) I will google these.\u000a\u000aAnyways, when holding my hands up palms facing each other, it's sort of a warm-ish tingly feeling, and almost feels magnetic. It's strange though because it feels like they're being drawn together but also pushed apart... Like they're the same sides of a magnet, but at the same time, the opposites? \u000a\u000aI am indeed curious to know why my energy is draining electronics, and any other information/advice/words of wisdom you have, but I'm not really sure what to ask.... Could we start with why the energy drains it and go from there? Why is it that my natural energy is stronger than it should be? \u000a\u000aThank you so much
p5825
sI2
VYou may call me sir, if you are so inclined. :)\u000a\u000aIt's a little difficult to explain exactly why the body's energy has the draining effect on electronics, considering that the concept of energy and the human aura have not been accepted by the scientific community, thus effectively ending research into the subject before it began.  So my explanation is speculative based on personal ideas and what little resources I could find.\u000a\u000aBasically, we know the brain creates its own electrical charges to perform cognitive processes.  This leads to the idea that the human aura is based on a sort of electromagnetic field.  When this electromagnetic energy comes into contact with electronic devices, it essentially saps them of their power.  It could be working in either of two ways:  Either your energy is using the electronics as a battery and draining them, or it may be over-clocking the electronics, causing them to short out.\u000a\u000aAs to why your natural energy is stronger than the average individual, it could be any number of causes.  Some people are just more in tune the subtle forces that lay beyond the typical human perception.  Often, this exists in families, so one possible cause is your bloodline, which may mean your ancestors were very spiritual people.  There's no real way to say exactly why it happens for any particular case.\u000a\u000aThe sensation that you got from your hands is the general feel of your energy when you're focusing on it.  You want to learn how to manipulate that, meaning increasing/decreasing its output, moving it to different parts of your body, and using it for beneficial purposes (like healing, giving yourself a second wind, etc.).  When you're meditating, focus on that sensation, then force it to move to various areas of your body to help you better understand how it works and how to manipulate it.  It's very helpful to use visualization techniques, such as imagining your aura and visualizing it to be a particular color perhaps.\u000a\u000aIf you've practiced Reiki, you should know about the idea of limitless "life force energy" humans are able to tap into.  It's focused in an area around the sternum (some beliefs state this is also the link to the human soul).  So a helpful meditation technique is to focus on that area and visualize energy pouring out of it and enveloping your physical body.\u000a\u000aAnd to answer your question on Tai Chi, it's quite beneficial.  Because it focuses on learning how to open your body to the flow of its chi, using it while focusing on your own energy will help you to understand how it flows.\u000a\u000aAfter enough practice and meditation, you should have complete control of your inherent energy.  It shouldn't have any erratic spikes or cause harm to any more electronics.
p5826
sI3
VThank you for your answers :)))\u000a\u000aI feel that the concept of energy and the human aura should be more accepted into the scientific community :/\u000a\u000aIt probably as my bloodline. On my birth mother's side, my cousin, who's the keeper of our family's stories and lineage says we come from a long line of witches and gypsies and we long ago we were some sort of French royalty. I'm not so sure about the lineage on my birth father's side. They're very Italian. \u000a\u000aHow do you mean by "giving yourself a second wind"? I do know of the idea of limitless life force energy, but I honestly haven't done anything with Reiki in a long time. I once dated a guy who hadn't done Reiki but he had very strong energy as well. It was interesting. I'd try to do Reiki on him, and he'd make it into a game by using his own energy on me as well... \u000a\u000aI'll definitely start meditating more and working on this. :)\u000a\u000aYou've been incredibly helpful. I feel like I have so many questions but I can't think of any >_<;;;
p5827
sI4
VBy "giving yourself a second wind," I mean that when you feel overwhelmed by exhaustion, you can tap into your personal energy source, successfully reinvigorating your physical body.  It's kind of like a quick recharge for your system.  This is where Chakra meditation is very helpful.  It relies upon "opening" specific energy centers in your body.  Once you learn the techniques to do so, it's as simple as opening a door.  This in turn causes the energy to flow in, and you become re-energized.\u000a\u000aI agree these concepts should be accepted and researched by the scientific community.  It's just difficult for scientists to believe in it due to the esoteric nature of energy, in that it needs to be felt and experienced by an individual before it can be understood.  I'm sure one day be accepted, just as many previously shunned sciences once were.

As a couple of folks have said below having multiple files for a single title will result in duplicates in the library.  There is a [feature request](http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=135178) on the Kodi forums to have a prompt appear when you open a title with multiple versions (like SD and HD or theatrical and extended cuts).

Its far too sterile and tame. I understand why it has to be that way, but its not terribly funny.\u000a\u000aNow, crossposting it to /r/exmormon may be a really stupid idea... Not only because of how tame the humor is, but because these caricatures that are written about in the BunYion are sugar-sweet awe-shucks sorts of images. They aren't self-deprecating, they're  along the same vein as the things that 14 year old girls on Facebook post to their walls saying "lolz, we're random." Its cute and funny for people in the clique, but its not ground-breaking, and kind of a put off for people outside of the circle. Especially the people who were annoyed by the circle enough to leave in the first place and congregate among other outsiders.\u000a\u000aAnd I do apologize if any of my statements come off as harsh. That is not my intent at all. I do think you've got a market, and I have seen BYU friends on Facebook post these things with their smiley faces and conversations a-packed with giggles. But you may just find yourself in the wrong crowd for the tame and sterile humor around these parts.

VHey, I'm a bit of a chrome and linux newbie. I bought a c720p for the purpose of python development, and a lot of things make me nervous.

VK just bought a lighthing fixture that is 4 50Watt gu10 bulbs. Everthing is already connected nicely and all i have to do is just connect the hot neutral and the ground feeding this. My question is the two conductor wire for the fixture is 18awg. is it ok for me to connect 14awg switch leg to it? Thank you. I havent taken off the current fixture yet so i dont know the wire size but im assuming its 14.
p5885

VInteresting.Whats the theory behind it? the wire only takes the load amps? wouldnt the wires need to be the circuit amp as well since it needs to complete a path to the neutral?
p5886
sI2
VThe wire to the fixture only carries the load of the fixture itself.
p5887
sI3
VOk. So even if the hot supplies 15 amps this fixture wire will only draw the amp neccesary for the load only and not the full 15 amps?
p5888

VThe hot has the potential to supply 15 amps, the fixture will only draw what it needs from that 15 amps.

Vok makes sense. I guess my mistake was thinking there was a constant 15 amps rather than ability for 15 amps.

VAlright so my friend and I decided to create teams on ORAS to face eachother. We are ev training them and all so basically I just need help thinking of a good team. Our rules are that the Team has to be the same type. Basically like a gym leader only uses one type. Although it can be dual types. So say my team is fire. I can use houndoom or heatran etc. as long as the fire type is in there. So i don't know what type to use yet. I was thinking steel, or maybe flying or normal. I don't know what he is picking and he doesn't know what I am picking. The main rules are that there can only be 2 ubers and one legendary and 3 other Pokemon. So 3 ubers in all if the legendary is an uber. And then also, only Pokemon up to the 4th gen. (We aren't fans of 5th gen+). So if anyone has some thoughts I'd love to hear them! Also mega forms are able to be used (only 1 obviously). If you have an idea let me know but also give me some rational behind it! Thanks so much!

p5918
sI3
VLudicolo is super fun if you're running a rain team. Just get rain up and bust out the swift swimmers. If you're going to run mono water might I suggest a team of politoed, manaphy, kyogre, swampert, kingdra, and ludicolo? This gives you a wide range of options for offense and defense depending on what sets you use and has good movepool options.
p5919
sI4
VPlease excuse my noobness, but does rain dance/rain make water Pokemon move faster?
p5920
sI5
VRain doesn't boost the speed of all water pokemon but some pokemon have the ability swift swim which doubles their speed in the rain. There is also a corresponding ability for sunny day called chlorophyll. Rain also lowers the damage done by fire attacks and raises the damage done by water attacks.

However, it took me three play through's where I was concentrating on PWWT/PBWT (btw, when you grab that unique weapon for the plat trophy, make sure the confirmation dialog is "you just picked up some awesome weapon" and not "you are encumbered".....).  I went back to the Nexus several times w/o the WT changing.  In fact I did this multiple times in 4-2 trying to get the pure bladestone, even going back to the Nexus to take a break, go eat lunch etc.  Only time I ever saw WT change is when I exited the game.  Of course when I played, the on-line activity was WAY lower then when most people probably got their plat trophies so that may have something to do with it.

VEspecialy with my voice, it sounds very 'uncomfortable' and thick. Oh btw I'm a guy and I'm 20 years old, identified as 'low'  baritone but I try to ignore my range limits.\u000a\u000ahttp://vocaroo.com/i/s1HYfdldm3lv Yes that's me but I cant seem to get my tone very smooth. It stays in this thick way troughout my whole range.\u000a
p5931
sI1
VWhere does your voice flip? I mean, where is your natural passage? Because I haven't spoke to a low baritone before, and I am very curious. And in what kind of higher register do you sing? What kind of coordination do you use? Because I am not gifted to belt all the way up, so after something like f4 I flip to the head register. How do you maintain your vocal stamina after the passagio? Do you mix?
p5932
sI2
VMy voice flips at B3, but I am able to belt until E4.  My tessitura (comfortable vocal range) is from a G2 - C4 (It used to only go up to G3) and I can extend my full tone to a E4. I can use my falsetto down to an A3.\u000aDo you flip to head voice or falsetto though after F4? That's two different co-ordinations I use, but mainly head voice. I mix from C4 to C5. \u000a\u000aYou don't need to be gifted to be belting, just don't strain. Vocalising "Haaaaa" to give your muscles some push can help you give the strength to your upper notes so they don't sound weak and falsetto-ey. \u000a\u000aTo ensure vocal stamina, the placement of the voice must be more forward and higher in the mouth than it usually is, but not so much you sound nasal. A good amount of "twang" can help you project your voice as well so it sounds sharper and doesn't get dragged down by the natural darkness of a baritone voice. You can't shy away from the support too. I used to be anxious when I did higher notes, so I forgot all my support and it was real bad\u000a\u000aAnything else? :)
p5933
sI3
VWell, I haven't sung with falsetto for like... 3 years? I have been working on my head voice for a very long time, and it just overpowers my falsetto in terms of dynamics. Falsetto is not my cup of tea.\u000a\u000a\u000aSo when I'm belting from my modal register, i flip around the f4, and then you hear this very scratchy head voice. But when I tend to sing with this weird open sensation from my ears, it sounds brighter and more steady. Maybe this is the palate thing, but with my chest voice it tends to be harder lol.\u000a\u000aIt depends on how I'm feeling. I just like my head voice very much. I can sing from a E3 to a scratchy G5.\u000a\u000a\u000aSo my lowest modal note would be a forced c#2. It is safer to state that my modal register spans E2 to the belted tone of a F4. And my head register would be comfy up to the D#5.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p5934

V> Well, I haven't sung with falsetto for like... 3 years?\u000a\u000aYou sure about that? Sounds to me like you switch briefly into falsetto on the word "like" in your recorded clip.

VBetween us, my business partner and I have experience on the retail floor and behind the scenes (marketing) of a bookstore, both independent and corporate. We have an idea we want to get off the ground -- but I have no idea where to start. I just left my full-time work and I'm paid through the summer, so I have two months of extra time to work with before I start another job. My hope is to use this time to sink into working on a stellar business model and making our business a reality.\u000a\u000aWhen opening a brick-and-mortar bookstore, it is necessary to start with a web presence or should we go into looking for a space? Have you started a bookstore? What did you wish you knew before you started? Were you successful?\u000a\u000aThanks for your insight!
p5946
sI1
VSure -- it's based on books being rich in illustration, with sections for picture books, graphic novels, and all in-between. Art-driven books for all ages, possibly also rare books in this category. We may also sell some artist supply for illustrators and graphic artists, as it looks like most bookstores do well selling non-book merchandise along with their readable stock. 
p5947
sI2
VOkay, then no, I don't really think a web presence is going to be a make or break proposition for you. However, knowing that, I have some advice:\u000a\u000aI would tell you to reach out to your closest comic-cons and sci-fi/fantasy/steampunk cons and ask them if they are familiar with and can give you and introduction to your local artists. Having a solid relationship with those people will allow you to have artist-fan events that are good crowd-builders and also, a community right off the bat. Talk to them before you open to bring in the books they recomend to con-goers and their fans. Advertise on their blogs (maybe cut them a deal to have some of their work on the walls in exchange for virtual space.)\u000a\u000aPlease have hours that are in line with your fans. So many small businesses where I live have bankers hours, M-F. This is why they fail -- because I work Bankers hours myself and I need evening hours to come visit stores! Consider being open W-S, closed Monday and Tuesday instead of a traditional week.\u000a\u000aConsider turning the children's area into an alcove that has some means of sound-reduction between that section and the rest of the store. I hated the childrens' section at my last local bookstore because it was a big open L-shape. No matter where you were in the store, if there were nosiy kids, you knew it.\u000a\u000aI know it's hard to afford staff out the gate, but please, please, please be properly staffed and don't use those "Back in Thirty Minutes!" Signs. There have been several times I've been ready to buy, go to a store, see that sign and realize.... I'm out of time and have to go pick the item up elsewhere. The biggest pull a brick-and-mortar store has on internet shopping is immediacy. To that end I also advise you to keep a WIDE spread of stock and not a ton of copies. If I want something in three days... I'm going to order it online, not from you. Sorry, that's how it is.\u000a\u000aIf you want me to expand on any of that, please ask. I may be assuming knowledge you don't have.
p5948
sI3
VThank you, this is all great advice! I went to a local art school, so I have a good idea of the people and places I can check in with -- this is Boston, so there will be no shortage of people who'd be interested in this niche and would be supportive. I frequent a few comic shops and artist communities, and know of a bunch more I can check with, so thanks! That sounds like a great place to start.\u000a\u000aI like what you're thinking about the children's section, and I'll give that some serious thought. Ideally (probably not all that possibly, but hey, I'm in the dream stages here) the children's section would be an entirely separate room from the other books, because I'd like to have a space to give art classes and readings. This is a part of the model, having one bookstore with two distinct sections, but I'm still in the very early planning stages.\u000a\u000aI completely hear you on staffing. I've had that problem myself and it's inexcusable. Ideally hours would something like be 8-7, Tuesday -- Sunday. \u000a\u000aThank you for this advice, greatly appreciated!
p5949
sI4
VI live in the Bay Area right now, but I've been to Boston and I know it has similar traffic issues. Please consider being open later than that. At least 8 -- I often don't get off work until nearly 7. If I give myself 30 minutes to drive somewhere, if you are open until 8 I can at least browse for 20 minutes before making a decision and high-tailing out before I become a bother. If you close at 7, I"m bang out of luck.\u000a\u000aIf you have local comic shops, I'd tell you to do your best to NOT duplicate the merchandise of the ones nearest to you. Most of the comic nerds I know are pretty married to their store anyway. \u000a\u000aIf you can't get an ideal space right away, what about making the kids area a big tent with fabric?
p5950
sI5
VYeah, this won't really be a comic nerd kind of place. More like artists, and the kind of books illustrators are drawn to. I'm not interested in carrying comic series or Manga or anything, just books heavy on image-driven narrative. Maybe things that wouldn't translate to ebook well, or large, detailed books that your really have to hold and spend time on. Like books as art as experience.\u000a\u000aI will absolutely be getting creative with room division!

VI will freely admit that I am not the most technologically inclined person, but all I could think of was that he was tired of dealing with me (because everything he told me to try - unplug/replug, switch the ends of the ethernet cable, hard reset, factory reset - I had already done before I resorted to calling tech support, with no luck) and decided to get rid of me by giving me rubbish advice in the form of a Spinal Tap reference.\u000a\u000a\u000aIf he was actually meaning that I should switch the wifi to channel 11, is that something that I can/should do, or is that something that I actually need to call AT&T (whose router it is) and have them do it?\u000a\u000a\u000a(Also, if the device is plugged with an ethernet cable directly into the ~~modem~~  router that AT&T provided, does the wifi channel really actually matter?)\u000a\u000a\u000aEdited for clarity.

Venergize super clicks, you get 5x click damage, 59% crit, 18x multiplier. So 5x times .59*18 (since 59% of those clicks will be 18x higher, this gives you average click damage) = 53.1x per click\u000a\u000a(because super clicks adds 2x click damage, so with energize it's 2x+2x, just to clarify that bit.)\u000a\u000aenergize lucky strikes, you get 3x click damage, 100% crit, 18x multiplier. So 3x*18 (since 100% of those clicks will be 18x higher) = 54x per click\u000a\u000a(this is with all current upgrades as of .08)\u000a\u000aGoing to sleep now, I'll check for replies when I wake up. If I goofed up somewhere I'm willing to admit I was wrong. :P
p6006
sI5
VEnergize super clicks will result in more damage than you think. There are two possibilities: crit (0.59) and not crit (0.41). So the expected damage multiplier is: prob_crit * crit_mult + prob_not_crit.\u000a\u000aThe resulting damage multiplier is 5 * (0.59 * 18 + 0.41) = 55.15.

The items cost the same and therefore you'd be able to switch it up instantly. Your proposed change would complete remove the small decision making process there and not punish what you'd later realise wasn't the optimal decision.

VA great read! For me, it raises lots of questions about the extent to which mastering a game system or setting is playing the game well. In my players, I see a really interesting tension between tinkering with (exploiting?) the game mechanics and portraying interesting characters. Some players get sick of a game once they have figured out how to min-max. Others, once they've retired a hero to the pantheon of the campaign world. In both cases they've learned a lot of tangible things... right?\u000a\u000a(My favorite bit...) I'll have to meditate on the following:\u000a"The uniquely human ability to pass on stories and thereby learn important practical, moral, and social lessons has been invaluable to us. Since the more recent developments of drawing and then writing we have been able to experience stories without even having direct access to the original storytellers, and even more recently the printing press and now movies and television have literally let us see someone else's story, and these various forms of storytelling now rank among peoples' favorite forms of entertainment. And remembering the basic premise of Natural Funativity, it's easy to see how these also are ways that we learn how to deal with situations critical to survival, reproduction, and their social equivalents that in human society are often linked to social standing. "
p6049
sI2
VThis is a bit tangential, but you might find it interesting:\u000a\u000aThe quotation that interests you refers to an insight that is fundamental to the field called ethical criticism. The main proponents (whose names I can remember) are Rene Wellek, Wayne C. Booth, and Marshall Gregory.\u000a\u000aEthical criticism would add another dimension to the study of game narratives by asking what kinds of lessons do they invite players to learn ('invite' being the key word here; players may not necessarily embrace the lesson) via how they are structured and the kind of game play they privilege.\u000a\u000aIt's an area of research I'm very interested in, but I haven't spent much time lately checking what else is out there.\u000a\u000aEDIT: none of the authors I mentioned have looked at games; they are literature scholars. But their arguments would, for the most part, still apply.

VSounds not unlike Cicero's goals of rheotric: to delight, to instruct, and to move.

VJabber and Mumble are our two out of game methods of communicating.

Mumble is kind of quiet in the general chat lounge, but is also important for fleets, because it's where all the communication happens.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, we have the "Deedeereddit" channel in-game for all the newbros to ask questions, which stays pretty active and chatty talking about all sorts of things, sometimes just shooting the breeze, other times talking through how to spiral in on an enemy so your frigate isn't turned to dust in a couple seconds.\u000a\u000aKeep in mind, I'm pretty new here too.

It has the 34'' barrel, no mounts for a scope (which is fine with me). \u000a\u000aAnyways, he left me this rifle. It's never been fired and I just got it yesterday. it's .45\u000a\u000aI will eventually shoot it since he'd for sure want me to, but I'm going to do my homework first.\u000a\u000aSo, I have a few questions. I what type of round would I buy to put though it? I know that it's a .45 but on the top of the barrel, it just says ".45". It doesn't mention if it's .45-70 or .45-110 or anything in between (or even bigger?). Can it shoot both and anything in between? I'd like it to shoot whatever it was designed to fire, not sure if black powder or smokeless is better. I know you need to clean it more thoroughly if you shoot black powder though it.\u000a\u000aI'm going to buy a hard case for it, one that will lessen any moisture getting in there and doing bad stuff while its not in use.

VI wish people would be more specific when they say how long they've played. An hour a day for 6 months? Been at it a couple months, but you have 4 hours a day on average? To just give a week/month/year, without knowing the hours is pretty vague. \u000a\u000aI see people say something like "it took me a year to get that down." It can be discouraging for someone starting out, but then you hear they only got 3 hours a week in that year and it makes all the difference. \u000a\u000aEdit: I was on my phone when I posted this last night and I thought this morning. "How many times did they play this song?" So 30 times for 7m 4s each time means that they put in *at least* 5h 30m into the song. Since it's a safe bet that a bit of time was spent on riff repeater on some of the tricky parts, that time has to be higher.\u000a\u000aAnd also like /u/dildo_cd0 said, scores and percentages in this game are misleading. It doesn't count overplaying based on what it's asking for. So I can play notes 3-4 times when it's only asking for 2 because my timing sucks. I can play when it's not asking me to play anything. I can also hit notes wrong and it count them right. There are plenty of times the game says "You did great!" and I'm thinking "We must not be listening to the same thing..." I've gotten streaks because I just kept thumping away when there was really nothing there.

VI was thinking about mid 00's(ofc i know about Superbowl winning era) "bad guys" that "could play" Raiders during e.g. Sapp's tenure here,a lot of loud mouth washed up vets,and problematic young guys that were expected to turn it around at some point but never did,that just gave everybody motive to ridicule us. To me i prefer the clean cut GB look,and good guys with character better than loudmouth problematic guys that RM kinda avoided both in FA and the Draft. Your opinion?

sI1
VThis is basically what the Madden era Raiders were like. 
p6099
sI2
VWell... The rules were a bit different then though. Jack Tatum would be paying half his salary in fines if he were hitting like that for us today.\u000a\u000aAlso stories I've heard say that our Raiders weren't exactly angels off the field either. But that was awesome, they'd party with fans before games, etc. \u000a\u000aLike it or hate it, modern NFL doesn't have a place for a team like that any more.
p6100
sI3
VI mean you're right but you can still keep that blueprint so to speak. Be as nasty as the rules currently allow you to be, I don't think the team will have any issues off the field so I'm very happy when it comes to off the field stuff.

VSo based on the responses a post I made here a while back, I now make screening the goalie one of my priorities in the offensive zone. I'm not 100% sure how to react to some of the situations in the offensive zone while I am screening however. When the shot comes, do I jump out of the way or stay in front of the goalie and hope it goes between my legs? And if there's a rebound do I jam at it or pass it out to one of the other forwards? At what point is it considered goalie interference and can I get in the crease or not? I know these are a lot of questions but the answers to my last post really helped me a lot with my game and I'm hoping you can help me again.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Since I made this post, I have gotten a chance to use some of the tips, and they were of great help. My buddy who is the goaltender I practice my screening on told me "dude, they're gonna hate you in the league", so that's something! One thing that I noticed that probably would help other people reading this post for tips, is to keep your feet slightly pointed towards each other. This is so when the goaltender shoves you it will be easier to regain your position and in some cases not move at all.
p6118
sI1
VThanks, sorry, one more question, should I be standing upright so I can take away more of the goalie's vision or bent forward with my stick on the ice ready for the deflection etc.?
p6119
sI2
VUpright. Try to take up as much space as you can. Watch some Tomas Holmstrom video. Super helpful.
p6120
sI3
VNo. Never stand upright on the ice ever. The goalie isn't standing upright and if he has to look over top of you he is either too tall to screen or going to be slow getting to the ice.\u000a\u000aKeep your stick on the ice in front of you making a triangle with your skates and keep your knees bent so you can quickly accelerate to a rebound or to open ice to support a teammate. 
p6121
sI4
VRight. By upright I meant upright in an athletic position (knees bent, bent at the midsection). 
p6122
sI5
VYes I have always been taught and then taught that upright is bad. What you described is essentially the "hockey stance" in most circles and is good all over the ice. Upright to me has always meant knees locked and stick off the ice.

The most important part will always be to cover the "corners".\u000a\u000aI wish you could edit that "bad protection" back simply because it's pure speculation preventing people from getting what I think is an excellent case.

I sent them the references as soon as I arrived home.\u000a\u000aHowever, my question is, is this a good sign of their interest, or is it just standard procedure?  I know that each company or agency is different, but I'm just wondering.  I've contacted all of my references to let them know except for one, and I plan to write him tomorrow morning as soon as I'm up early.\u000a\u000aAnyway, that's the question.  I have another interview next week, so better to figure it out now, I suppose.  I'm going to contact my references in advance next time before my next interview so they have a heads up just in case....\u000a\u000a**edit**: References checked today.  They called and are hoping to move forward.  Now the waiting game begins!  Have another interview next week for something else, so I'll have a little something to fall back on just in case!

VWell, that gives me hope then!  I also interviewed with another agency, and I had finger prints done for them but they didn't ask for references -- at least not yet.  My completed application is currently with HR in DC after passing through the local field office.  I guess it just depends on each individual agency.  Still waiting to hear back from the one that has sent off my full application for final review.  That could be months, though.  Full steam ahead.

V*Sawaki*: Science progresses rapidly because researchers base their work on information accumulated by other scientists and then develop their own findings. Human beings cannot cultivate our spirituality the same way, because we can't receive the results of other people's practice and base our own practice on them. Each of us has to start from the beginning. We can't start from the point our teachers reached. This is why human beings with technology are like children playing with lethal weapons. It's very dangerous.\u000a\u000a*Uchiyama*: Some people think that in the future, scientific advancement will solve every problem and make everyone wealthy and happy. When I head someone speaking this way, I think the person is really simpleminded. It's like riding a train thinking happily about the air-conditioned, comfortable first-class coach, while standing in the aisle of a crowded second-class car, covered with sweat on a summer's night.\u000a\u000aAs science and technology continue to advance, some of the serious problems of the present will be solved. When I was young, my wife died of tuberculosis. If the medicines we have now had been available then, I wouldn't have lost her. I sincerely appreciate scientific progress.\u000a\u000aBut it's nonsense to think that all our problems can be solved through scientific advancement. Science is an endeavor of making, and mankind is an abstract concept. Mankind existed ten thousand years ago and will exist ten thousand years from now. On the contrary, each of us has a transitory life of only about seventy or eighty years. In the years given, it's a real problem that we don't know how to manage our lives.\u000a\u000aIt's not bad to dream about the future of science, but it's more important to consider the big picture of our short lives and find a place where we can be stable.\u000a\u000a*Okumura*: Until the 1960's, when Uchiyama Roshi wrote this article, many people thought the world was improving because of the development of science and technology. But since then we have come to understand that science, technology, and the economy based on them are also the main causes of environmental destruction. This is really "an inconvenient truth". Our efforts to make our lives easier and wealthier destroy parts of the network of interdependent origination. Injuring this living network is hurting ourselves in the long run. About fifty years have passed since we recognized this problem, and yet our behavior doesn't seem to be changing much.\u000a\u000aAmong human beings it seems there are two groups. Some people can take advantage of science and technology to create systems through which they can make money; these are the passengers in the first-class cabin. Another group is in the second-class coach without air-conditioning. It's said that 99% of human beings are in the second group, and 1% own 99% of the wealth on earth.\u000a\u000aMore than half of humanity is starving or undernourished, and yet people in developed countries suffer from overeating. This isn't a healthy condition for anyone. We need to work on transforming our situation. A contribution we can make from Buddhist tradition is the teaching of living with little desire and knowing satisfaction, and working diligently not merely to satisfy our wants but to maintain the health of the entire network of interdependent origination.

What if he was satisfied with the way things were?\u000a\u000abut there were some other things in there that made me roll my eyes too, like this:\u000a\u000a>But since then we have come to understand that science, technology, and the economy based on them are also the main causes of environmental destruction.\u000a\u000ascience is basically just prediction of outputs given specific inputs and the refining of that model for increased accuracy. it doesn't necessarily destroy anything. as far as technology and the economy go, presuming that the destruction of the environment is "bad" it still is basically just the actions of the people/lack of understanding of consequences that would be the problem, not the technology or economy itself.\u000a\u000athere were a couple things i found i agreed with in here, like:\u000a\u000a> Some people think that in the future, scientific advancement will solve every problem and make everyone wealthy and happy.\u000a\u000ai even agree that this is a silly idea. but i've been in a hot sweaty summer train and i've been in a nice cool AC train, and i was happy during both! independent of the science! being in a hot sweaty crowded summer train isn't a problem. and the science didn't confuse me into thinking it would solve my problems!\u000a\u000asilly

VRent is the most that you will ever pay for housing. A mortgage is the least you will ever pay for housing.\u000a\u000aPlus, OP is a student moving here, so we can assume that he's got family elsewhere and/or might not be here past four years. In which case, a mortgage could be throwing money away too.\u000a\u000aThat said, there are also plenty of condos around that are cheaper to buy than to rent, and a lot of the cost associated with exterior maintenance should be covered by the HOA fee. That's never a sure thing, as HOA fees can go up, but still, I think it would be a good compromise between homeownership and rent for a student. I know some people buy their kids condos near LSU so that they can tailgate once the kids graduate and move on.

The header has no functionality so its wasted space to me.\u000a\u000a* The spacing/padding between submissions is increased, meaning I see 20% less submissions per screen. This spacing does not increase usability because that is provided by font sizes and link colors.\u000a\u000aThese aren't huge issues (obviously) but they make me wonder what we got in return for them.

VMy Lords,\u000a\u000aWhile Pakistan does posses nuclear weapons, it's military and the facilities attached to it are the only capable part of the government , last I checked public confidents in Pakistan was higher in the military than the government and for quite good reasons at times. \u000a\u000aPakistan has a struggling schools system, that major source of funding is for Wahhabi Islam religious schools that are coming from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u000a\u000aThese schools often focused Wahhabism Islam over traditional schooling, these schools also often exclude female students from any kind of education and membership of these schools also often comes with recommendations for family members to embrace female gentile  , and Wahhabism. \u000a\u000aThese schools are wile not always free they're often assisted for payments. This and the lack of standard schooling makes these schools despite there hangups the best option for education to improve ones family in these regions.      
p6185
sI2
VMy Lords.\u000aPakistan not only has nuclear weapons, but it also has a space program. There is a risk that any aid we give will mean a reduction in the education budget. Meaning that in effect we will be paying for their nuclear weapons program and space program.         \u000aThe problem of human rights still remains.  The must be a link between aid and human rights. This should be linked to all planed aid we give.       \u000aA further problem occur with " The Defence ministry shall be tasked with providing the engineers safety if it is determined, by the ministry, the location is at risk of conflict.".  Is this not imperialism? Surely the host country should be approached to gain their permission first. 
p6186
sI3
VMy Lords,\u000a\u000aWile the Earl of Merseyside , raises some good points, Pakistan nuclear and space  program is in response to India's version of the same program. I am doubt full that the Pakistan government will decrease it's own funding of it's education program as it has recognised it as a major way for them to reduce terrorism. Pakistan's funding problems don't come from a lack of allocated funds but an inability  to collect them. \u000a\u000a>The problem of human rights still remains. The must be a link between aid and human rights. This should be linked to all planed aid we give.\u000a\u000aI am firmly against punishing the people of a nation due to a governments actions , of all the people to raise this issue I did not believe it would come from such a loyal member of labour as your self. It was my understanding that the labour party wished to promote equality amongst people of this country and the wider world. It is completely unfair to withhold aid for people that most desperately need it, due to the actions of their government.\u000a\u000a>A further problem occur with " The Defence ministry shall be tasked with providing the engineers safety if it is determined, by the ministry, the location is at risk of conflict.". Is this not imperialism? Surely the host country should be approached to gain their permission first.\u000a\u000aWith the question of permission is answered in this bill;(2) b \u000a\u000a>with the consultation of the respective sovereign governments.\u000a\u000aNon of this will be done without consultation of the national governments. It is not imperialistic as much as you may insist it is to place forces in position to protect NGO's or local builders, of course the forces  provided do not necessary have to be British forces I'm sure the minster for foreign affairs and the minster for defence can arrange that local forces participate.  \u000a\u000aI also seem to remember much of your party wanting to place forces to protect British engineers to repair a dam in Iraq. Seems quite similar to me, and hypocritical for your party to request the same thing to be done in a different occasion in fact I seem to remember that motion instating we did this instead of negating for it. \u000a

VMr Deputy Speaker.    \u000aThe Mosul dam is entirely different. There we are talking about saving tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of lives. It is a thing which needs doing now, not a thing which can wait while negotiations are completed.          \u000aI do support helping others, but I also don't want to be taken for a mug. There are some very rich people in Pakistan and pressure should be put on the government to tax them at an appropriate rate.         \u000aI don't believe aid should be handed out without proper monitoring and the ability to withdraw that aid if things change for the worse.  Neither of these safeguards are in the bill.

VMy Lords,\u000a\u000aI'm not sure if this is comment is directed at the rest of this house or the deputy speaker specifically. \u000a\u000aNone the less I will respond. \u000a\u000a>The Mosul dam is entirely different. There we are talking about saving tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of lives. It is a thing which needs doing now, not a thing which can wait while negotiations are completed.\u000a\u000aThe lack of education in these nations is an imminent problem that does put the future and possibly the lives of thousands of people at threat. \u000a\u000a>I do support helping others, but I also don't want to be taken for a mug. There are some very rich people in Pakistan and pressure should be put on the government to tax them at an appropriate rate.\u000a\u000aPakistan already taxes those of a higher income at 35% , but it wouldn't matter if there tax rate was 75% like it is in France, as I have stated already they have a problem collecting their taxes. \u000a\u000aMany of the very rich people in Pakistan don't pay there taxes there, they pay them here as we are a much better country for them to host their companies , as we have better access to skilled workers who can read write and do maths, who can apply their skills in running a business or performing engineering.  \u000a\u000a >I don't believe aid should be handed out without proper monitoring and the ability to withdraw that aid if things change for the worse. Neither of these safeguards are in the bill.\u000a\u000aYou may notice that this bill includes plans for complete withdrawal of uk workers within three years, this is so that it is completely under the control of the local people and NGO's. This is to ensure that we do not need to fund this any longer than needed. It is also not a bills job to out line a power that DfID already has such as revaluating and withdrawing aid.

VWell today was the day we were expecting to receive the end of the month bonuses that include 4.5 star staffs and mythril and major growth eggs the JP version has enjoyed every month since reaching this point in the cycle.  Instead we got orb conversion and ability shattering.  My guess is DeNA tried to cover up not getting the extra bonus card with the orb feature.\u000a\u000aI guess it is another feature us second class global citizens will go without along with rolling gatcha and collab events.\u000a\u000aI really would have liked those 4.5 star items.
p6214

VUhh there are 10 rewards on the card and 31 days in January.  10 days before the 31st is the 21st (today).  We got conversion/shattering on this day instead of one week after the UI update like the JP client.\u000a\u000aFeel free to drink the DeNA koolaid, but these type of things makes me regret making a global account instead of a JP account and every day that passes the difference grows wider and wider.
